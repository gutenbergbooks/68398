THE ARRIVAL</h2>

<p class="ph2">I</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> fog of November in its descent upon Laxton,
one of London’s busiest suburbs, had effaced the
whole of Beaconsfield Villas, including the Number
Five on the fanlight over the door of the last house
but two in the row. To a tall girl in black on her way
from the station this was a serious matter. She was
familiar with the lie of the land in the light of day
and in darkness less than Cimmerian, but this evening
she had to ask a policeman, a grocer’s boy, and a
person of no defined status, before a kid-gloved hand
met the knocker of her destination.</p>

<p>It was the year 1890. Those days are very distant
now. Victoria the Good was on the throne of Britain.
W.G. went in first for Gloucestershire; Lohmann and
Lockwood bowled for Surrey. The hansom was still
the gondola of London. The Tube was not, and eke
the motor-bus. The <i>Daily Mail</i> had not yet invented
Lord Northcliffe. Orville Wright had not made good.
William Hohenzollern used to come over to see his
grandmother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>Indeed, on this almost incredibly distant evening in
the world’s history, his grandmother in three colors
and a widow’s cap, with a blue ribbon across her bosom,
surmounted the sitting-room chimney-piece of Number
Five, Beaconsfield Villas. And at the other end of the
room, over the dresser, was an old gentleman with a
beard, by common consent the wisest man in the realm,
who talked about “splendid isolation,” and gave Heligoland
to deep, strong, patient Germany in exchange for
a tiny strip of Africa.</p>

<p>Yes, there were giants in those days. And no doubt
there are giants in these. But it is not until little Miss
Clio trips in with her scroll that we shall know for
certain, shall we?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the first crisp tap the door of Number Five
was flung open.</p>

<p>“Harriet, so here you are!”</p>

<p>There was welcome in the eyes as well as in the voice
of the eager, personable creature who greeted the visitor.
There was welcome also in the gush of mingled gas and
firelight from a cosy within.</p>

<p>“How are you, Eliza?”</p>

<p>The tall girl asked the question, shut the door, and
kissed her sister, all in one breath, so that only a
minute quantity of a London “partickler” was able to
follow her into the room.</p>

<p>The hostess pressed Harriet into a chair, as near the
bright fire as she could be persuaded to sit.</p>

<p>“What a night! I was half afraid you wouldn’t
face it.”</p>

<p>“I always try to keep a promise.” The quiet, firm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
voice had a gravity and a depth which made it sound
years older than that of the elder sister.</p>

<p>“I know you do&mdash;and that’s a lot to say of anyone.
How’s your health, my dear? It’s very good to
see you after all these months.”</p>

<p>Chattering all the time with the artlessness of a
nature wholly different from that of her visitor, Eliza
Kelly took the kettle from the hob and made the tea.</p>

<p>Beyond a superficial general likeness there was
nothing to suggest the near relationship of these two.
The air and manner which invested the well-made coat
and skirt, the lady-like muff and stole, with a dignity
rather austere, were not to be found in the unpretentious
front parlor opening on to the street, or in its
brisk, voluble, easy-going mistress.</p>

<p>“Harriet, you are really all right again?” Eliza impulsively
poured out the tea before it had time to brew,
thereby putting herself to the trouble of returning it to
the pot.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.” Harriet removed her gloves elegantly.
She was quite a striking-looking creature of nine-and-twenty.
In spite of a recent illness, she had an air
of strength and virility. The face and brow had been
cast in a mold of serious beauty, the eyes, a clear deep
gray, were strongholds of good sense. Even without
the aid of a considered, rather formidable manner,
this young woman would have exacted respect anywhere.</p>

<p>“Take a muffin while it’s warm.”</p>

<p>Harriet did so.</p>

<p>“I had no idea your illness was going to be so bad.”</p>

<p>The younger woman would not own that her illness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
had been anything of the kind; she was even inclined
to make light of it.</p>

<p>“Why, you’ve been away weeks and weeks. And
Aunt Annie says you’ve had to have an operation.”</p>

<p>“Only a slight one.” The tone was casual. “Nothing
to speak of.”</p>

<p>“Nothing to speak of! Aunt Annie says you have
been at Brighton I don’t know how long.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know,” said Harriet in a discreet, rather
charming voice, “they thought I was run down and
that I ought to have a good rest. You see, the long
illness of her Grace was very trying for those who had
to look after her.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Although her Grace has been dead
nearly two years. Anyhow, I hope the Family paid
your expenses.” The elder sister and prudent housewife
looked at Harriet keenly.</p>

<p>“Everything, even my railway fare.” A fine note
came into the voice of Harriet Sanderson.</p>

<p>“Lucky you to be in such service,” said Eliza in a
tone of envy.</p>

<p>Slowly the color deepened in Harriet’s cheek.</p>

<p>“By the way, what are you doing at Buntisford?
Does it mean you’ve left Bridport House for good?”</p>

<p>“It does, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“But I thought Buntisford had been closed for years?”</p>

<p>“His Grace had it opened again, so that he can go
down there when he wants to be quiet. He was always
fond of it. There’s a bit of rough shooting and a
river, and it’s within thirty miles of London; he finds
it very convenient. Of course, it’s quite small and easy
to manage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>“What is your position there?”</p>

<p>“I’m housekeeper,” said Harriet. “That is to say,
I manage everything.”</p>

<p>The elder sister looked at her with incredulity, in
which a little awe was mingled. “Housekeeper&mdash;to the
Duke of Bridport&mdash;and you not yet thirty, Hattie.
Gracious, goodness, what next!”</p>

<p>The visitor smiled at this simplicity. “It’s hardly
so grand as it sounds. The house doesn’t need much
in the way of servants; the Family never go there.
His Grace comes down now and again for a week-end
when he wants to be alone. Just himself&mdash;there’s never
anyone else.”</p>

<p>“But housekeeper!” Eliza was still incredulous. “At
twenty-nine! I call it wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Is it so remarkable?” Harriet’s calmness seemed
a little uncanny.</p>

<p>“The dad would have thought so, had he lived to see
it. He always thought the world of the Family.”</p>

<p>The younger sister smiled at this artlessness.</p>

<p>“Every reason to do so, no doubt,” she said with a
brightening eye and a rush of warmth to her voice.
“I am sure there couldn’t be better people in this world
than the Dinnefords.”</p>

<p>“That was the father’s opinion, anyway. He always
said they knew how to treat those who served them.”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of that,” said Harriet. “They have
been more than good to me.” The color flowed over
her face. “And his Grace often speaks of the father.
He says he was his right hand at Ardnaleuchan, and
that he saved him many a pound in a twelvemonth.”</p>

<p>“I expect he did,” said Eliza, her own eyes kindling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
“He simply worshiped the Family. Mother used to
declare that he would have sold his soul for the
Dinnefords.”</p>

<p>“He was a very good man,” said Harriet simply.</p>

<p>“It would have been a proud day for him, Hattie,
had he lived to see you where you are now. And not
yet thirty&mdash;with all your life before you.”</p>

<p>But the words of the elder sister brought a look of
constraint to the face of Harriet. Mistaking the cause,
Eliza was puzzled. “And it won’t be my opinion only,”
she said. “Aunt Annie I’m sure will think as I do.
She’ll say you’ve had a wonderful piece of luck.”</p>

<p>“But the position <i>does</i> mean great responsibility”&mdash;there
was a sudden change in Harriet’s tone.</p>

<p>Eliza kept her eyes on the face of the younger woman,
that fine Scots face, so full of resolution and character.
“Whatever it may be, Hattie, I’m thinking you’ll just
about be able to manage it.”</p>

<p>“I mean to try.” Harriet spoke very slowly and
softly. “I mean to show myself worthy of his Grace’s
confidence.”</p>

<p>The elder sister smiled an involuntary admiration;
there was such a calm force about the girl. “And, of
course, it means that you are made for life.”</p>

<p>But in the eyes of Harriet was a fleck of anxiety.
“Ah! you don’t know. It’s a big position&mdash;an awfully
big position.”</p>

<p>Eliza agreed.</p>

<p>“There are times when it almost frightens me.”
Harriet spoke half to herself.</p>

<p>“Everything has to run like clockwork, of course,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
said the sympathetic Eliza. “And it’s bound to make
the upper servants at Bridport House very jealous.”</p>

<p>“It may.” The deep tone had almost an edge of
disdain. “Anyhow it doesn’t matter. I don’t go to
Bridport House now.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t tell me, my dear, that they like to hear
of her Grace’s second maid holding the keys in the
housekeeper’s room.”</p>

<p>The calm Harriet smiled. “But it’s only Buntisford,
after all. You speak as if it was Bridport House or
Ardnaleuchan.”</p>

<p>Eliza shook a knowledgeable head. “They won’t like
it all the same, Hattie. The dad wouldn’t have, for
one. He was all his life on the estate, but he was turned
fifty before he rose to be factor at Ardnaleuchan.”</p>

<p>“Well, Eliza”&mdash;there was a force, a decision in the
words which made an end of criticism&mdash;“it’s just a
matter for the Duke. The place is not of my seeking.
I was asked to take it&mdash;what else could I do?”</p>

<p>“Don’t think I blame you. If it’s the wish of his
Grace there is no more to be said. Still, there’s no
denying you’ve a big responsibility.”</p>

<p>At these words a shadow came into the resolute eyes.</p>

<p>Said the elder sister reassuringly, “You’ll be equal to
the position, never fear. That head of yours is a good
one, Hattie. Even Aunt Annie admits that. By the
way, have you seen her lately?”</p>

<p>“Seen&mdash;Aunt Annie?” said Harriet defensively. The
sudden mention of that name produced an immediate
change of tone in her distinguished niece.</p>

<p>“She’s been asking about you. She wants very much
to see you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>The shadow deepened in Harriet’s eyes. But an
instant later she had skillfully covered an air of growing
constraint by a conventional question.</p>

<p>“How’s Joe, Eliza?”</p>

<p>“Pretty much as usual. He’ll be off duty soon.”</p>

<p>Joe Kelly was Eliza’s husband, and a member of the
Metropolitan police force. In the eyes of her family,
Eliza Sanderson had married beneath her. But Joe, if a
rough diamond, was a good fellow, and Eliza could afford
not to be over-sensitive on the score of public opinion.
Joe had no superficial graces, it was as much as he could
do to write a line in his notebook, high rank in his calling
was not prophesied by his best friends, but his wife
knew she was well off. They had been married eight
years, and if only Providence had blessed a harmonious
union in a becoming manner, Eliza Kelly would not
have found it in her heart to envy the greatest lady in
the land. But Providence had not done so, the more
was the pity.</p>

<p>“By the way,”&mdash;Eliza suddenly broke a silence&mdash;“there’s
a piece of news for you, Hattie. A friend is
coming to see you at five.”</p>

<p>“A friend&mdash;to see me!”</p>

<p>“To see you, my dear. In fact, I might say an admirer.
Can’t you guess who?”</p>

<p>“I certainly can’t.”</p>

<p>“Then I think you ought.” Mischief had yielded to
laughter of a rather quizzical kind.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that I had any admirers&mdash;in Laxton.”</p>

<p>The touch of manner delicately suggested ducal circles.</p>

<p>“You can have a husband for the asking, our Harriet.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
The eternal feminine was now in command of the situation.</p>

<p>Harriet frowned.</p>

<p>“I can’t think who it can be.”</p>

<p>“No?” laughed the tormentress. “You are not going
to tell me you have forgotten the young man you met
the last time you were here?”</p>

<p>It seemed that the distinguished visitor had.</p>

<p>“I do call that hard lines,” mocked Eliza. “You have
really forgotten him?”</p>

<p>“I really have!”</p>

<p>“He has talked of you ever since. When was Miss
Sanderson coming again? Could he be invited to meet
her? He wanted to see her aboot something verra impoortant.”</p>

<p>A light dawned upon Harriet’s perplexity.</p>

<p>“Surely you don’t mean&mdash;you don’t mean that red-headed
young policeman&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Dugald Maclean. Of course, I do. He has invited
himself to meet you at five o’clock.” Eliza sat back in
her chair and laughed at the face of Harriet, but the
face of Harriet showed it was hardly a laughing matter.</p>

<p>“Well!” she cried. Her eyes were smiling, yet they
could not veil their look of deep annoyance.</p>

<p>“Now, Hattie,” admonished the voice of maternal
wisdom, “there’s no need to take offense. Don’t forget
you are twenty-nine, Dugald Maclean is a smart young
man, and Joe says he’ll make his way in the world.
Of course, you hold a very high position now, but if
you don’t want to find yourself on the shelf it’s time
you began to think very seriously about a husband.”</p>

<p>“We will change the subject, if you don’t mind.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
The tone revealed a wide gulf between the outlook of
Eliza Kelly and that of a confidential retainer in the
household of the Duke of Bridport.</p>

<p>“Very well, my dear. But don’t bite. Have the last
piece of muffin. And then I’ll toast another for Constable
Maclean.”</p>

<p class="ph2">II</p>

<p>The clock on the chimney-piece struck five. Before
its last echo had died there came a loud knock on the
front door.</p>

<p>Constable Maclean was a ruddy young Scotsman. He
was tall, lean, large-boned, with prominent teeth and
ears. Although freckled like a turkey’s egg, he was not
a bad-looking fellow. His boots, however, took up a
lot of space in a small room, and the manner of his
entrance suggested that the difficult operation known as
“falling over oneself” was in the act of consummation.
But there was an intense earnestness in his manner, and
a personal force in his look, which gave a redeeming
grace of character to a shy awkwardness, verging on
the grotesque.</p>

<p>“Good afternune,” said Constable Maclean, removing
his helmet with a polite grimace.</p>

<p>One of the ladies shook hands, the other welcomed
the young man with a cordial good-evening and bade him
sit down. Constable Maclean, encumbered with a
regulation overcoat, sat down rather like a performing
bear.</p>

<p>At first conversation languished. Yet no welcome
could have been more cordial than Eliza’s. She felt like
a mother to this young man. It was her nature to feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
like a mother to every young man. Moreover, Dugald
Maclean, as he sat perspiring with nervousness on the
edge of a chair much too small for him, seemed to need
some large-hearted woman to feel like a mother towards
him.</p>

<p>Miss Harriet Sanderson was to blame, no doubt, for
the young policeman’s aphasia. Her coolness and ease,
with a half quizzical, half ironical look surmounting it,
seemed to increase the bashfulness of Dugald Maclean
whenever he ventured to look at her out of the tail of
his eye.</p>

<p>It was clear that the young man was suffering acutely.
Nature had intended him to be expansive&mdash;not in the
Sassenach sense perhaps,&mdash;but given the time and the
place and a right conjunction of the planets, Dugald
Maclean had social gifts, at least they were so assessed
at Carrickmachree in his native Caledonia. Moreover,
he was rather proud of them. He was an ambitious
and gifted young police officer. For many moons he
had been looking forward to this romantic hour. Since
a first chance meeting with the semi-divine Miss
Sanderson he had been living in the hope of a second,
yet now by the courtesy of Providence it was granted
to him he might never have seen a woman before.</p>

<p>The lips of Constable Maclean were dry, his tongue
clove to the roof of an amazingly capacious mouth. As
for Miss Sanderson, mere silence began to achieve
wonders in the way of gentle, smiling irony. But the
hostess was more humane. For one thing she was married,
and although Fate had been cruel, she had a sacred
instinct which made her regard every young man as a
boy of her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>Every moment the situation became more delicate,
but Eliza’s handling of it was superb. She brewed a
fresh cup of tea for Constable Maclean, and then plied
the toasting-fork to such purpose that the young man
became so busy devouring muffins that for a time he
forgot his shame. Eliza could toast and butter a muffin
with anyone, Constable Maclean could eat a muffin with
anyone&mdash;thus things began to go better. And when,
without turning a hair, the young man entered upon his
third muffin, Miss Sanderson dramatically unbent.</p>

<p>“Allow me to give you another cup of tea.” The
voice was melody.</p>

<p>A succession of guttural noises, which might be interpreted
as “Thank ye kindly, miss,” having come
apparently from the boots of Constable Maclean, Miss
Harriet Sanderson handed him a second cup of tea.</p>

<p>Still, the conversation did not prosper. But the perfect
hostess, kneeling before the fire in order to toast
muffin the fifth, had still her best card to play. It was
the ace of trumps, in fact, and when she rose to spread
butter over a sizzling, delicious, corrugated surface, she
decided that the time had come to make use of it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the factor in the situation which moved her
to this step was that only one muffin now remained for
her husband when he came off duty half-an-hour hence,
and that his young colleague of the X Division seemed
ready to go on devouring them until the crack of doom.</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” Eliza suddenly remarked as she
cut the fifth muffin in half, “I promised Mrs. Norris I
would go across after tea to have a look at her latest.”</p>

<p>“You are not going out, Eliza, such a night as this?”
said Harriet in a voice of consternation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>“A promise is a promise, my dear, you know that.
Mrs. Norris has just had her sixth&mdash;the sweetest little
boy. Some people have all the luck.”</p>

<p>“But the fog&mdash;you can’t see a yard in front of you!”</p>

<p>“It’s only just across the street, my dear.”</p>

<p class="ph2">III</p>

<p>As soon as Eliza, hatted and cloaked, had gone to
see Mrs. Norris’s latest, a change came over Constable
Maclean. He was a young man of big ideas. But all
that they had done for him so far was to turn life into
a tragedy. By nature fiercely sensitive, the shyness
which made his life a burden had a trick of crystallizing
at the most inconvenient moments into a kind of dumb
madness. A crisis of this kind was upon him now.
Yet he had a will of iron. And in order to keep faith
with the highest law of his being that will was always
forcing him to do things, and say things, which people
who did not happen to be Dugald Maclean could only
regard as perfectly amazing.</p>

<p>His acquaintance with Miss Sanderson was very
slight. They came from neighboring villages in their
native Scotland; many times he had gazed from afar on
his beautiful compatriot, but only once before could he
really be said to have met her. That was months ago,
in that very room, when he had been but a few days in
London. Since then a very ambitious young man had
thought about her a great deal. The force and charm
of her personality had cast a spell upon him; this was
a demonic woman if ever there was one; he had hardly
guessed that such creatures existed. It would be wrong
to say that he was in love with her; his passion was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
centered upon ideas and not upon people; yet Harriet
Sanderson was already marked in the catalogue as the
property of Dugald Maclean.</p>

<p>“Do you like vairse?” inquired the young man, with
an abruptness which startled her.</p>

<p>The unexpected question was far from the present
plane of her thoughts, but it was answered to the best
of her ability.</p>

<p>“Yes, I like it very much,” she said, tactfully.</p>

<p>“I’m gled.” Constable Maclean unbuttoned his great
coat.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the mind of Harriet lurked the romantic
hope that this remarkable young man was about to
produce a hare or a rabbit after the manner of a wonder-worker
at the Egyptian Hall. But in this she was disappointed.
He simply took forth from an inner pocket
of his tunic several sheets of neatly-folded white foolscap,
and handed them to Miss Sanderson without a word. He
then folded his arms Napoleonically and watched the
force of their impact upon her.</p>

<p>“You wish me to read <i>this</i>?” she asked, after a brief
but sharp mingling of confusion and surprise.</p>

<p>The young man nodded.</p>

<p>With fingers that trembled a little, she unrolled the
sheets of a fair, well-written copy of “Urban Love, a
trilogy.”</p>

<p>She read the poem line by line, ninety-six in all, with
the face of a sphinx.</p>

<p>“What do ye think o’ it, Miss Sanderrson?” There
was a slight tremor in the voice of the author. The
silence which had followed the reading of “Urban Love,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
a trilogy” had proved a little too much, even for that will
of iron.</p>

<p>“It is very nice, if I may say so, very nice indeed,” said
Miss Sanderson cautiously.</p>

<p>“I’ll be doin’ better than that, I’m thinkin’.” A certain
rigidity came into the voice of the author of the
poem. The word “nice,” was almost an affront; it had
come upon his ear like a false quantity upon that of a
classical scholar.</p>

<p>“Did you really do it all by yourself?” The inquiry
was due less to the performance, which Harriet was
quite unable to judge, than to the author’s almost terrible
concentration of manner, which clearly implied
that it would not do to take such an achievement for
granted.</p>

<p>“Every worrd, Miss Sanderrson. Except&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Except what, Mr. Maclean?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Lonie, the Presbyterian Minister, helped me a
bit wi’ the scansion.”</p>

<p>“If I may say so, I think it is remarkably clever.”</p>

<p>It appeared, however, that these pages were only the
opening stanzas of a poem which was meant to have
many. They were still in the limbo of time, behind
the high forehead of the author, but upon a day they
would burst inevitably upon an astonished world.
Would Miss Sanderson accept the dedication?</p>

<p>Miss Sanderson, blushing a little from acute surprise,
said that nothing would give her greater pleasure. She
was amazed, she wanted to laugh, but the intense, almost
truculent earnestness of the young man had put an
enchantment upon her.</p>

<p>But all this was simply a prelude to the great drama<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
of the emotions which Constable Maclean had now to
unfold. He had broken the ice with the charmer. The
butterfly was pinned down with “Urban Love, a trilogy,”
through its breast. Miss Sanderson had never had time
for reading, therefore she was in nowise literary. Thus,
perhaps, it was less the merit of the work itself, which
must be left to the judgment of scholars, than the force,
the audacity, the driving-power of its author which
seemed almost to deliver her captive into his hands.</p>

<p>She, it seemed, was its <i>onlie</i> true begetter. The poem
was in her honor. Heroica, calm and fair, was the protagonist
of “Urban Love, a trilogy,” and she was Heroica.
The position was none of her seeking, but it carried with
it grave responsibilities.</p>

<p>In the first place it exposed her to an offer of marriage.
“Urban Love, a trilogy,” had broken so much
of the ice that Dugald Maclean plunged horse, foot and
artillery through the hole it had made. At the moment
he could not lead Heroica to the altar; it would hardly
be prudent for a young constable of eight months’ standing
to offer to do so, but he sincerely hoped that she
would promise to wait for him.</p>

<p>Galled by the spur of ambition, Dugald Maclean took
the whole plunge where smaller men would have been
content merely to try the depth of the water.</p>

<p>Miss Sanderson was frozen with astonishment. It was
true that “Urban Love, a trilogy,” had half prepared
her for a declaration in form, but she had not foreseen
the swiftness of the onset. This was her first experience
of the kind, but she was a woman of the world and
she gathered her dignity about her like a garment.</p>

<p>“Ye’re no offendit, Miss Sanderrson?” There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
something titanic in the slow mustering of his forces to
break an arid pause.</p>

<p>“I am not offended, Mr. Maclean.” The tone of Miss
Sanderson said she was offended a little. “But I do
think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What do ye think, Miss Sanderrson?” The naïveté
of the young man provoked a sharp intake of breath.</p>

<p>“I think, Mr. Maclean”&mdash;the candor of Miss Sanderson
was deliberate but not unkind&mdash;“if I were you, before I
offered to marry anybody, I should try seriously to
better myself.”</p>

<p>The words, pregnant and uncompromising, were
masked by a tone so deep and calm that a first-rate intellect
was able to treat them on their merits. In spite
of a flirtation with the Muses, this young man was a
remarkable combination of wild audacity and extreme
shrewdness. He had a power of mind which enabled
him to distinguish the false from the true. Thus he
saw at once, without resentment or pique, that the advice
of Heroica was that of a friend.</p>

<p>She had a strong desire to box the ears of this rawboned
young policeman for his impertinence; but at heart this
was a real woman, and the dynamic forces of her sex
were strong in her. It was hard to keep from laughing
in the face of this young man in a hurry, who rushed
his fences in a way that was simply grotesque; yet she
could not help admiring the power within him, and she
wished him well.</p>

<p>“It’s gude advice, Miss Sanderrson.” His tone of
detachment drew a ripple from lips that laughed very
seldom. “I’m thinkin’ I’ll tak’ it. But ye’ll bear the
matter in mind?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“I make no rash promises, Mr. Maclean.”</p>

<p>“Well, if ye won’t, ye won’t. But I’m thinkin’ I’d
work the better at the Latin if I could count on ye.”</p>

<p>“Studying Latin, are you, Mr. Maclean?” The surprise
of Miss Sanderson was rather respectful.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lonie is learnin’ me,” said the young man, with
a slight touch of vainglory. “And I’m thinkin’ he’ll
verra soon be learnin’ me the Greek.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to college?”</p>

<p>“Maybe ay. Maybe no. You never can tell where
a pairson may get to. Anyhow I’m learnin’ to speak the
language. Ae day I’ll be as gude at the Saxon as you
and your sister have become, Miss Sanderrson.”</p>

<p>It was hard not to smile, yet she knew her countrymen
too well to treat such a matter lightly.</p>

<p>“And I’ve a’ready set aboot writin’ for the papers.”</p>

<p>“Begun already to write for the papers, have you, Mr.
Maclean?” This was not a young man to smile at.
“Well, wherever you may get to,” Miss Sanderson’s tone
was softer than any she had yet used, “I am sure I
wish you well.”</p>

<p>“Thank ye,” said the young man dryly. “But why
not gie a pairson a helping hand?”</p>

<p>“I am not sure that I like you well enough.” Such
candor was extorted by the seriousness with which she
was now having to treat him. “You see, Mr. Maclean,
it is all so sudden. We have only met once before.”</p>

<p>“May I hope, Miss Sanderrson?”</p>

<p>Suddenly he moved his chair towards her and took
her hand.</p>

<p>“Mr. Maclean, you may not.” The hand was withdrawn
firmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Well, think it owre, Miss Sanderson.”</p>

<p>The young man moved back his chair to its first position
in order to restore the <i>status quo</i>.</p>

<p>Harriet shook her head. And then all at once, to the
deep consternation of Constable Maclean, she broke into
an anguish of laughter, which good manners, try as they
might, were not able to control.</p>

<p class="ph2">IV</p>

<p>In the midst of this unseemly behavior on the part
of Miss Sanderson, the door next the street was flung
open with violence. A figure Homeric of aspect emerged
from the night.</p>

<p>It was that of Constable Joseph Kelly, of the Metropolitan
Police; an ornament of the X Division, a splendid
man to look at, nearly six feet high. Broad of girth,
proportioned finely, his helmet crowned him like a hero
of old. His face, richly tinted by daily and nightly
exposure to the remarkable climate of London, was the
color of a ripe apple, and there presided in it the almost
god-like good-humor of the race to which he belonged.</p>

<p>This emblem of superb manhood was laden heavily.
There was his long overcoat, a tremendous, swelling
affair; there was his furled oilskin cape; at one side of
his girdle was his truncheon-case, his lamp at the other
side of it; in his left hand was a modest basket which
had contained his dinner, and in his right was a larger
wicker arrangement which might have contained anything.</p>

<p>“Is that our Harriet?” said Constable Kelly, in the act
of closing the door deftly with his heel. “Good evening,
gal. Pleased to see you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>He set down the large basket on the floor in a rather
gingerly manner, placed the small one on the table, came
to Harriet, kissed her audibly, and then turned to the
room’s second occupant with an air of surprise.</p>

<p>“Hello, Scotchie! What are <i>you</i> doing here?”</p>

<p>Before Dugald Maclean could answer the question he
was in the throes of a second attack of dumb madness.
This malady made his life a burden. When only one
person was by he seldom had difficulty in expressing
himself, but any addition to the company was apt to
plunge him into hopeless defeat.</p>

<p>“Up to no good, I expect.” Joseph Kelly, disapproval
in his eyes, answered his own question, since other answer
there was none. “I never see such a feller. Been
mashing you, Harriet, by the look of him.”</p>

<p>It was a bow drawn at a venture by a shrewd colleague
of the X Division. An immediate effusion of rose pink
to the young man’s freckled countenance was full of
information for a close observer.</p>

<p>“Durn me if he hasn’t!” Gargantuan laughter rose to
the ceiling.</p>

<p>Harriet blushed. But the look in her face was not
discomfiture merely. There was plain annoyance and a
look of rather startled anxiety for which the circumstances
could hardly account.</p>

<p>“Scotchie, you’re a nonesuch.” But Joe suddenly
lowered his voice in answer to the alarm in the face of
his sister-in-law. “You are the limit, my lad. Do you
know what he did last week, Harriet? I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>“Let me make you a cup of tea, Joe.” And his sister-in-law,
who seemed oddly agitated by his arrival, rose
in the humane hope of diverting the attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>But the story was too good to remain untold.</p>

<p>“It’ll take the X Division twenty years to live it down.”
Kelly throbbed and gurgled like a donkey-engine as he
fixed his youthful colleague with a somber eye. “This
young feller, what do you think he did last week?”</p>

<p>“The kettle will soon boil, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Harriet!”&mdash;the rich rolling voice thrilled dramatically&mdash;“about
midnight, last Monday week as ever was, this
smart young officer saw an old party in an eyeglass and
a topper and a bit o’ fur round his overcoat, standin’ on
the curb at Piccadilly Circus. He strolls up, taps him
on the shoulder, charges him with loitering with intent
and runs him in.”</p>

<p>“Here’s your tea, Joe.” The voice was sweetly polite.</p>

<p>“And who do you think the old party was, my gal?
Only a Director of the Bank of England&mdash;that’s all.
The rest of the Force is guying us proper. They want
to know when we are going to lock up the Governor.”</p>

<p>“Joe, your tea!”</p>

<p>“We’ll never get over it, gal, not in my time.
Scotchie, you are too ambitious. There isn’t scope for
your abilities in the Metropolitan Force. Turn your
attention to some other branch of the law. You ought
to take chambers in the Temple, you ought, my lad.”</p>

<p>But in answer to the look in the eyes of Harriet, her
brother-in-law checked the laugh that rose again to his
lips. There was a strange anxiety upon her face, an
anxiety that was now in some way communicated to him.
It was clear from the glances they exchanged and the
silence that ensued, that both were much embarrassed by
the presence of Maclean.</p>

<p>However, after the young man had entered upon a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
struggle for words with which to meet this persiflage and
they had refused to come forth, he suddenly noticed that
the hands of the clock showed a quarter to six and he
rose determinedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s time you went on duty,” said the sardonic
Kelly with an air of relief.</p>

<p>Constable Maclean, feeling much was at stake, made
a great effort to achieve a dignified exit. He was an odd
combination of the thick-skinned and the hypersensitive.
At this moment the shattering wit of his peer of the X
Division made him wish he had never been born, but he
was too dour a fighter to take it lying down.</p>

<p>“Gude-nicht, Miss Sanderrson.” With one more
grimace he offered a hand not indelicately.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Mr. Maclean.” The tone of studied
kindness was a salve for his wounds. The effrontery
of this young man did not call for pity. And yet it was
his to receive it from the sterling heart of a true
woman.</p>

<p>The smile, the arch glance, the ready handshake did
so much to restore Dugald Maclean in his own esteem,
that he was able to retire with even a touch of swagger,
which somehow, in spite of an awkwardness almost
comically ursine, sat uncommonly well on such a dashing
young policeman.</p>

<p>Indeed, the exit of Constable Maclean came very near
the point of bravado. For as he passed the large wicker
basket which Kelly had placed on the floor, the young
man turned audaciously upon his tormentor. Said he
with a grin of sheer defiance:</p>

<p>“What hae ye gotten i’ the basket, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Never you mind. ’Op it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>Less out of natural curiosity, which however was
very great, than a desire to show all whom it might
concern that he was again his own man, Dugald Maclean
laid his hand on the lid of the basket.</p>

<p>“What hae ye gotten, Joe? Rabbuts?”</p>

<p>“If you must know, it’s a young spannil.” The
answer came with rather truculent hesitation.</p>

<p>“A young spannil, eh? I’m thinkin’ I’ll hae a look.”</p>

<p>“Be off about your duty, my lad.” Joe began to look
threatening.</p>

<p>“Juist a speir.”</p>

<p>“’Op it, I tell you.”</p>

<p>But in open defiance, Dugald Maclean had already
begun to untie the string which held the lid of the basket
in place. The majestic Kelly rose from his tea. Without
further words he seized the young man firmly from
behind by the collar of his coat. And then he hustled
him as far as the door in a very efficient professional
manner, straight into the arms of Eliza, who at that
moment was in the act of entering it.</p>

<p class="ph2">V</p>

<p>At the open door there was a brief scurry of laughter
and protest which ended in a riot of confusion. And
then happened an odd thing. But of the three persons
struggling upon the threshold of Number Five only one
was aware of it, and he had the wit to raise a great voice
to its highest pitch in order to conceal a fact so remarkable.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake hold your noise, Joe, else you’ll
frighten the neighbors,” said Eliza, getting in it at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
and indulging in suppressed shrieks at the manner of
Dugald Maclean’s putting out.</p>

<p>An instant later, the young policeman was in the street
and the door of Number Five, Beaconsfield Villas, had
closed upon him. But his singular exit was merely the
prelude to an incident far more amazing.</p>

<p>In the uproar of Joe had been fell design. As soon
as it ceased the reason for it grew apparent. An incredible
sound was filling the room.</p>

<p>“Whatever’s that!” Eliza almost shrieked in sheer
wonderment.</p>

<p>Harriet’s behavior was different. For a moment she
was spellbound. The look in her eyes verged upon
horror.</p>

<p>It seemed that a child was crying lustily.</p>

<p>“Wherever can it be!” cried the frantic Eliza.</p>

<p>A wild glance round the room told Eliza that there
was only one place in which it could be. Her eyes fell
at once on the large wicker basket, which had been set
on the floor near the fire.</p>

<p>“Well, in all my born days!”</p>

<p>She rushed to the basket and began furiously to untie
the lid. But the maxim “the more haste the less speed”
was as true in 1890 as it is today. Eliza’s fingers merely
served to double and treble knot the string.</p>

<p>Uncannily calm, Harriet rose from the table, the bread
knife in her hand. In silence she knelt by the hearth
and cut the knot. The deliberation of her movements
was in odd contrast to Eliza’s frenzy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="illo1"><img src="images/i_024.jpg" width="300" alt="“How did you come by it, Joe?”" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“How did you come by it, Joe?”</p>

<p class="p2">The lid was off the basket in a trice. And the sight
within further emphasized the diverse bearing of the
two women. Harriet rose a statue; Eliza knelt in an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>ecstasy. One seemed to gloat over the sight that met
her eyes; the other, with the gaze of Jocasta, stood turned
to stone.</p>

<p>It was the sweetest little baby. In every detail immaculate,
bright as a new pin, its long clothes were of a fine
quality, and it was wrapped in a number of shawls. A
hot-water bottle was under its tiny toes, and a bottle of
milk by its side.</p>

<p>Eliza’s first act was to take the creature out of its
receptacle. And then began the business of soothing it.
Near the fire was a large rocking-chair, made for motherhood,
and here sat Eliza, the foundling upon her knee.
Evidently it had a charming disposition. For in two
shakes of a duck’s tail it was taking its milk as if nothing
had happened. Yet the calm, tense Harriet had a little
to do with that. The milk was her happy thought.
Moreover, she tested its quality and temperature with
quite an air of experience. And the effect of the milk
was magical.</p>

<p>As soon as sheer astonishment and the cares of
motherhood would permit, a number of searching questions
were put to Constable Kelly.</p>

<p>“How did you come by it, Joe?” was question the
first.</p>

<p>Before committing himself in any way, Joe scratched
a fair Saxon poll like a very wise policeman, indeed.
It was as if he had said, “Joseph Kelly, my friend,
anything you say now will be used in evidence against
you.”</p>

<p>At last, cocking at Harriet a cautious eye, he replied
impressively, “I’ll tell you.” But it was not until Eliza<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
had imperiously repeated the question that he came to
the point of so doing.</p>

<p>So accustomed was Joseph Kelly to the giving of evidence
that unconsciously he assumed the air of one upon
his oath.</p>

<p>“I was <i>perceding</i>” said he, “about twenty-past four
through Grosvenor Square, on my way to Victoria, when
I see through the fog this bloomin’ contraption on a
doorstep.”</p>

<p>“What was the number?” Eliza asked.</p>

<p>“I was so flabbergasted, I forgot to look.”</p>

<p>“Well, really, Joe!”</p>

<p>“When I saw what was in the basket, I was so took,
as you might say, that it was not until I was at the end
of the street that I thought of looking for the number.
And then it was too late to swear to the house.”</p>

<p>“In Grosvenor Square?” said Harriet.</p>

<p>“I’m not <i>per</i>cisely sure. The fog was so thick in
Mayfair you could hardly see your hand before you. It
may have been one of them cross streets going into Park
Lane.”</p>

<p>“A nice one you are, Joe.” And Eliza began to croon
softly to the babe in her arms.</p>

<p>Kelly stroked his head perplexedly.</p>

<p>“I am,” he said, solemnly. “A proper guy I’ll look
when I take it to the Yard tomorrow and they ask me
how I come by it.”</p>

<p>“Take it to the where?” asked Eliza sharply.</p>

<p>“To Scotland Yard the first thing in the morning, to
the Lost Property Department.”</p>

<p>“There’s going to be no Scotland Yard for this sweet
lamb.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“If I had done my duty it’d ha’ gone there tonight.”</p>

<p>Said Eliza: “You haven’t done it, Joe, so it’s no use
talking. And if I have a say in the matter, you are not
going to do it now.”</p>

<p>Here were the makings of a very pretty quarrel. But
Eliza had one signal advantage. She knew her own
mind, whereas Joe evidently did not know his. By his
own admission he had already been guilty of a grave
lapse of duty. And in Eliza’s view that was a strong
argument why the creature should stay where it was.
It would be foolish for Joe to give himself away by
taking it to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>The argument was sound as far as it went, but when
it came to the business of the Metropolitan Force, Joe
was a man with a conscience. As he said, with a dour
look at Harriet, two wrongs didn’t make a right, and to
suppress the truth by keeping the kid would not clear
him.</p>

<p>But Eliza was adamant. Joe had made a fool of himself
already. He had nothing to gain by landing himself
deeper in the mire, whereas the heart of a mother had
yearned a long eight years for the highest gift of Providence.
The truth was that from the outset Joseph Kelly
had precious little chance of doing his duty in the matter.</p>

<p>Perhaps he knew that. At any rate he did not argue
his case as strongly as he might have done. And Eliza,
rocking the babe on her knee, in the seventh heaven of
bliss, rent Joe in pieces, laughed him to scorn. Harriet,
standing by, a curious look on her face, well knew how
to second her; yet the younger woman did not say a
word.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes Joe had hauled down his flag.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
Really he had not a chance. It was a very serious lapse
from the path of duty, but what could he do, the
simpleton!</p>

<p>“‘Finding is keeping’ with this bairn,” said the triumphant
Eliza.</p>

<p>It was then that the silent, anxious, hovering Harriet
claimed a share of the spoils of victory.</p>

<p>“Eliza,” she said, “if you are to be the sweet thing’s
mother, I must be its godmother.”</p>

<p>“You shall be, my dear.”</p>

<p>Harriet sealed the compact by a swift, stealthy kiss
upon the cheek of the foundling, who now slept like a
cherub on the knee of its new parent.</p>

<p>“The lamb!” whispered Eliza.</p>

<p>Tears of happiness came into the eyes of the mother-elect.
Harriet turned suddenly away as if unable to bear
the sight of them.</p>

<p>Said Joe to himself: “This is what I call a rum
’un.” But even in the moment of his overthrow, he did
not forget the philosophical outlook of that august body
of men, whose trust he had betrayed. He turned to his
long neglected cup of tea, now cold alas! and swallowed
it at a gulp. He then went on with the solemn business
of toasting bread and eating it.</p>

<p>To add to Joe’s sense of defeat, the two women paid
him no more attention now than if he had not been in
the room at all.</p>

<p>“The sweetest thing!” whispered the one ecstatically.</p>

<p>“What shall we call it?” whispered the other.</p>

<p>“A boy or a girl?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a girl.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>“By its mouth. A boy could never have a mouth like
that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that, my dear. I’ve seen boys with
mouths&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But look at the dimples, my dear.”</p>

<p>“I have seen boys with dimples&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“&mdash;&mdash;Joe Kelly, you are the durnedest fool alive.”
This emotioned statement was the grace to a very substantial
slice of buttered toast. Joe ate steadily, but
his countenance now bore a family likeness to that of
a bear.</p>

<p>“Suppose we say Mary? It’s the best name there is,
I always think.”</p>

<p>“But it may turn out a George, my dear. I hope it
will.”</p>

<p>“I feel sure it’s a Mary,” affirmed the godmother of
the sleeping babe. “I wonder who are the parents?”</p>

<p>“Whoever’s child it may be,” said the mother-elect,
“one thing is sure. They are people well up. I don’t
think I ever saw a child so cared for. And, my dear,
look at the shape of that chin and the set of that ear.
And that lovely hand&mdash;a perfect picture with its filbert
nails. Look at the fall of those eyelids. No wonder it
comes out of Grosvenor Square.”</p>

<p>“Grosvenor Square I’ll not swear to,” came a further
interpellation from the table.</p>

<p>“Get on with your tea, Joe,” said the mother-elect.
“What we are talking of is no concern of yours.”</p>

<p>The miserable Joe took off his boots and put on a
pair of carpet slippers.</p>

<p>“You’ve made a bad slip-up, my boy,” he remarked, as
he did so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>The two women continued to croon over the wonder-child.
Joe took a pipe, filled it with shag and lit it
dubiously. This was a bad business. He was a great
philosopher, as all policemen are, but whenever a grim
eye strayed across the hearth, it was followed by a frown
and a grunt of perplexity.</p>

<p>Joe smoked solemnly. The women prattled on. But
quite suddenly, like a bolt from a clear sky, there came
a very unwelcome intrusion. The street door was flung
open and a young constable entered breathlessly.</p>

<p>Dugald Maclean was received with surprise, anger,
and dismay. “Now then, my lad, what about it?” demanded
Joe, with a snarl of suppressed fury.</p>

<p>“I’m seekin’ ‘Urban Love, a trilogy,’” proclaimed
Dugald Maclean; and he spoke as if the fate of the
empires hung upon his finding it.</p>

<p>“Seekin’ what, you durned Scotchman?” said the
alarmed and disgusted Joe.</p>

<p>With deadly composure, Harriet rose from the side of
the sleeping babe.</p>

<p>“Mr. Maclean, it is there,” she said, icily. And she
pointed to the table where the precious manuscript reclined.</p>

<p>“Thank ye,” said Dugald, coolly. And he proceeded
to button into his tunic “Urban Love, a trilogy.”</p>

<p>But the mischief was done. The alert eye of an ambitious
police constable had traveled from the open basket
at one side of the fire to the object at the other, sleeping
gently now upon Eliza’s knee. A slow grin crept over
a freckled but vulpine countenance.</p>

<p>“Blame my cats,” he muttered, “so there’s the young
spannil.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>Joe rose majestically. He said not a word, but again
taking the intruder very firmly by the collar of his regulation
overcoat, hustled him with quiet truculence through
the open door into the street. Closing the door and turning
the key, he then went back to his meditations, looking
more than ever like a disgruntled bear.</p>

AUNT ANNIE AND AUNTY HARRIET</h2></div>

<p class="ph2">I</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>unt Annie</span> was the first to be told the great
news. In the view of both nieces it was in the
natural order of things that this august lady
should take precedence of the rest of the world. She
was so incontestably the family “personage,” the eminence
she occupied was such a dizzy one, that it would
have been just as unthinkable not to grant her priority in
a matter of such vital importance, as it would have been
to deny it to Queen Victoria in an affair of State.</p>

<p>In point of fact, Aunt Annie, within her own orbit,
was the counterpart and reflection of her Sovereign. In
an outlook they were alike, they were alike in the range
of their ideas, and well-informed people had said that
they had tricks of speech and manner in common. This
may have been a little in excess of the truth, one of those
genial pleasantries it is the part of wisdom to accept in
the spirit in which they are offered, but it would be wrong
to deny that in the suburb of Laxton Aunt Annie took
rank as a very great lady.</p>

<p>It is true that she lived in a small and modest house
in an unpretentious street, but all the world knew that
the flower of her years had been passed in abodes very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
different. And not only that, it was also known that
every year on her birthday, the twenty-sixth of March,
those whom it is hardly right to mention in these humble
pages came to call on her. On the twenty-sixth of every
March, sometime in the afternoon, a remarkable equipage
would appear before the chaste precincts of “Bowley,”
Croxton Park Road. At that hour every self-respecting
pair of eyes in the immediate neighborhood would be
ambushed discreetly behind curtains in order to watch the
descent of a real live princess with a neat parcel.</p>

<p>The contents of the parcel were said to vary from
year to year. Now it would be a piece of choice needlework,
fashioned by the accomplished hands of Royalty
itself, which would take the shape of a cushion or a footstool,
now a framed photograph of Prince Adolphus or
Princess Geraldine in significant stages of their adolescence,
now a chart of the august features of even more
important members of the family. Many were the historical
objects disposed about Aunt Annie’s sitting-room,
which the elect of the neighborhood had the privilege of
seeing and handling when they came to call upon her.
But when all was said, the undoubted gem of the collection
was a superb edition, bound in full calf, of the
Poems of A. L. O. E., with a certain signature upon the
fly-leaf. This was always kept under glass.</p>

<p>It chanced that Aunt Annie had invited herself to tea
at Number Five, Beaconsfield Villas, the day after the
arrival of the babe. This was strictly in accord with
rule and precedent. She was far too much a personage
to be invited by her niece Eliza, but if she intimated by
a letter, which was the last word in precision, that she
proposed to call on a certain day, Eliza humbly and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
gratefully overhauled the best tea service and polished
the lacquer tray which was only used on State occasions.</p>

<p>Not merely the mother-elect, but also godmother
Harriet, saw the hand of a very special Providence in
the impending visit of Aunt Annie to Beaconsfield Villas.
It was only right and fit that the news should be first told
to her. The matter must have her sanction. By comparison
the rest of the world was of small account. The
entire clan Sanderson lived in awe of her, and particularly
her imprudent and démodé niece Eliza. The
prestige of Aunt Annie was immense, and it did not make
things easier for those who lived within the sphere of
her influence that the old lady was fully alive to the
fact.</p>

<p>Eliza confided to Harriet that she would breathe more
freely when the morrow’s visit had taken place. Harriet
boldly said it didn’t really matter what view Aunt Annie
took of the affair. But Eliza knew better. In spite of
the joys of vicarious motherhood, there could be no
peace of mind for Eliza until the fateful day was over.</p>

<p>Half-past four in the afternoon was the hour mentioned
in the official note. And it was then, punctual to
the minute, that a vehicle of antique design even for that
remote period of the world’s history, in charge of a
Jehu to match it, drew up on the cobblestones exactly
opposite Number Five. The fog had cleared considerably
since the previous evening, therefore three urchins,
spellbound by the appearance of such a turnout in their
own private thoroughfare, beheld the slow and stately
emergence of a superbly Victorian bonnet of the most
authentic design and a black mantle of impressive simplicity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Jehu, like the equipage itself, jobbed for the occasion,
was the mirror of true courtliness. He had an uncle in
the Royal stables, therefore he knew the deference due
to the august Miss Sanderson. In promoting her descent
from the chariot he did not actually take off his hat, but
he stood with it off in spirit; a fact sufficiently clear to
the three youthful onlookers, one of whom remarked in
a voice of awe, “It’s the mayoress.”</p>

<p>Eliza, quaking over her best tea service on its elegant
tray, knew without so much as a glance through the
window that Aunt Annie had come. But she waited for
the knock. And then apronless, in her best dress, with
never a hair out of place, she opened the door with a
certain slow stateliness. Before her <i>mésalliance</i> she had
had great prospects as lady’s maid.</p>

<p>“Good morning, dear Eliza.”</p>

<p>It was four o’clock in the afternoon, but the distinguished
visitor undoubtedly said, “Good morning, dear
Eliza.” Moreover, she offered a large and rigid cheek
and Eliza pecked at it rather nervously.</p>

<p>The door of Number Five closed upon Jehu, upon his
wonderful and fearful machine, and also upon the general
public.</p>

<p>“And how is Joseph?”</p>

<p>“Nicely, thank you, Aunt Annie. I hope <i>you</i> are quite
well.”</p>

<p>“As well as my rheumatism will permit.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you take off your things?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, no, my dear.”</p>

<p>Aunt Annie would rather have died than take off her
things in that house. In her heart she had never been
able to forgive Eliza her marriage. Joseph Kelly was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
a worthy fellow no doubt, a good husband, and a conscientious
police officer, but by no exercise of the imagination
could he ever occupy the plane of a Sanderson. It
may have been mere pride of family but then pride of
family is a queer thing.</p>

<p>Poor Eliza had fallen sadly from grace. She had come
down in the world, whereas a true Sanderson always
made a point of going up in it. Even if Eliza’s relations
as a whole were inclined to take a sympathetic view of
her marriage, the one among them who really counted,
was never quite able to overlook the fact in her dealings
with her. Eliza had cause to feel nervous for Aunt
Annie was never so impressive as when she entered the
modest front parlor of Number Five.</p>

<p>It was easy for Aunt Annie to do that, because nature
was on her side. With the honorable exception of her
friend, Alderman Bradbury, the present mayor of the
borough, she had more personality than anyone in
Laxton. For forty years she had moved in the highest
circles in the land. Moreover, she had moved in them
modestly, discreetly, with the most punctilious good
sense. She had known her place exactly, had kept it,
therefore, with ever increasing honor and renown; but
the spirit of imperious self-discipline which had entered
into her in the process, sternly required that ordinary
people in their dealings with her should know their
place, too, and also be careful to keep it. In the domestic
circle Aunt Annie was a pitiless autocrat, and in public
life even the Mayor of Laxton and its leading Aldermen
did not withhold their deference when she condescended
to converse with them upon matters relating to the infant
life of the borough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>No wonder Laxton’s leading inhabitants kow-towed
to Aunt Annie. No wonder niece Eliza cowered in spirit
when she superbly entered that modest dwelling and sat
in its most capacious chair. Tea was offered her, without
sugar and with only a very little milk according to
her stoical custom.</p>

<p>“Thankee, my dear.”</p>

<p>The great lady removed a black kid glove, and
coquetted with a delicate slice of bread and butter. If
you have lived in palaces most of your days you know
that simplicity in all things is the true art of life. Right
at the back, as Eliza well knew, Aunt Annie was by no
means so simple as she made a point of seeming. Her
tastes and manners were modeled upon a sublime Original,
but as the memoirs of the time have shown in the
one case that things may not be always what they seem,
the same held true in the other.</p>

<p>Eliza had never felt so nervous in her life. Even the
historic hour in which she had first announced her
engagement to Joe could hardly compare with this. But
it was not until Aunt Annie had passed to her second
piece of bread and butter that the thunderbolt fell.</p>

<p>“A cradle, my dear!”</p>

<p>It was quite true that a cradle was in the chimney
corner, within three yards of Laxton’s leading authority
on the subject. Moreover, it was a cradle of the latest
design, a cradle of the most elegant contour, it was a
cradle provided with springs and lace curtains.</p>

<p>Eliza blushed hotly and murmured something about
Harriet having had it sent that morning. And then all
at once she became so confused that she began to pour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
out her own tea into the slop-basin instead of the cup
provided for the purpose.</p>

<p>“Harriet who, my dear?”</p>

<p>There was only one Harriet, and Eliza knew that Aunt
Annie knew that. It was a mere ruse to gain time&mdash;if
such a word can be used without impropriety in such
connection. Eliza sought to cover her confusion by a
sedulous holding of the tongue, and by an attempt to
pour out her tea as if she really knew what she was
about.</p>

<p>“What is there in it?”</p>

<p>The demand was point-blank. It was almost passionate.</p>

<p>Without waiting to be told what there was in it, Aunt
Annie rose, tea cup and all, and with the glower of a
sibyl drew aside the curtains.</p>

<p class="ph2">II</p>

<p>Mary was sleeping. Empirical science had proved her
beyond a doubt to be a Mary. And she was sleeping
as the best Marys do at the age of one month and a
bittock, with her thumb in her mouth&mdash;if they are
allowed to do so.</p>

<p>To say that Aunt Annie was taken aback would be
like saying that Zeus was a little offended with certain
events when he blew the planet Earth out of the firmament
in the year 19&mdash;. However!&mdash;it was as much as
Aunt Annie could do to believe the evidence of her eyes.
She fronted her niece augustly.</p>

<p>“And you never told <i>me</i>, my dear.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t come till last evening,” stammered Eliza.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>But a leading authority, even upon a subject so recondite,
is not deceived in that way.</p>

<p>“The child is five weeks old if it’s an hour,” scornfully
affirmed the expert. “Besides,”&mdash;the eye of the expert
transfixed her niece piercingly&mdash;“do you suppose&mdash;a
woman of my experience&mdash;needs to be told&mdash;but why
pursue the subject!”</p>

<p>For the moment Eliza felt so guilty that she was quite
unable to pursue the subject. Yet there was no reason
why she should allow herself to be overwhelmed, except
that Aunt Annie had an almost sublime power of putting
people in the wrong. The situation in sheer grandeur
and magnitude was altogether too much for her. And
the mind of Aunt Annie, capable of volcanic energy
when dealing with the subject it had made its own, had
already traveled an alarming distance before Eliza could
impose any check upon it.</p>

<p>“A very fine child&mdash;a very fine child indeed&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>The portentous gravity of the words should have
brought a chill to the soul of Eliza. But for some odd
reason it caused her to laugh hysterically.</p>

<p>“It is not a laughing matter,” said the face of Aunt
Annie; her stern lips made no comment on the preposterous
behavior of her niece.</p>

<p>“She’s mine,” gasped Eliza, when laughter had brought
her to the verge of tears.</p>

<p>“Tell that to the Marines,” said the face of Aunt
Annie. In fact the face of Aunt Annie said more
than that. It said, “Eliza, I should like to give
you the soundest shaking you have ever had in your
life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“Joe and I have adopted it,” gurgled Eliza at last.</p>

<p>Aunt Annie drew herself up to her full, formidable,
dragoon-like height of five feet ten inches, and gazed
sublimely down from that Olympian elevation.</p>

<p>“Then why not say so, my dear, in so many
words, without making yourself so profoundly ridiculous?”</p>

<p class="ph2">III</p>

<p>With tingling ears, Eliza humbly admitted her fault.
But as soon as she had done so, there arose a serious
problem, for a simple creature in whose sight the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth was very precious.
Aunt Annie began to ask questions&mdash;questions
which forbade a person of ordinary discretion to answer
with candor.</p>

<p>Whose was the child? What was its origin? What
did the parents&mdash;&mdash;? Why did the parents&mdash;&mdash;?
When did the parents&mdash;&mdash;? Did Eliza fully realize the
grave nature of the responsibility she was taking upon
herself?</p>

<p>It was the last question of the series that Eliza
answered first. And this she did for a sufficient reason:
to answer the others was wholly beyond her power.</p>

<p>“We may be doing a very unwise thing,” said Eliza.
“Joe and I know that.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I hope you do, my dear. But tell me,
where did you get it?”</p>

<p>The voice of truth enjoined on a doorstep in
Grosvenor Square, but the voice of prudence said otherwise.
And the voice of prudence sounded a very clear
and masterful note in Eliza’s ear, for Joe, Harriet, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
she were fully agreed that the true story must
not be given to the world. Diplomacy was called
for. Such a forthright creature was quite unversed
in that dubious art, but she must prepare to use
it now.</p>

<p>“I promised I wouldn’t tell.” Alas! that crude
formula was all in the way of guile that poor flustered
Eliza could muster at the moment.</p>

<p>Less by instinctive cleverness than by divine
accident there was a world of meaning, however, in that
faltering tone. And a word to the wise is sufficient.
There was not a wiser woman in England than Aunt
Annie, except&mdash;of course, that is to say!&mdash;speaking
merely for the lieges of the realm&mdash;.</p>

<p>“Very well, I don’t press the question.” It was the
tone she had once accidentally overheard a very great
Personage use to Lord Gr-nv-lle.</p>

<p>Eliza sighed relief.</p>

<p>“But, let me say this,” Aunt Annie looked steadily
at her niece. “I ask no questions in regard to the parents,
but whoever they may be, you must know that you run
a risk. The offspring of a regular union are often unsatisfactory,
the offspring of an irregular union, although
I praise heaven I have had no personal experience of
them, always bring sorrow to those with whom they
have to do.”</p>

<p>Eliza could only reply that the creature was such a
dear lamb that she was quite prepared to take the risk.
Aunt Annie shook a solemn head at her niece, and then
surveyed the infant in true professional style. The babe
still slept. Before the great critic and connoisseur made
any comment she removed the thumb from the delightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
mouth. And the act was done with such delicacy as
not to bring a cloud to the dreams of this wonderful
Mary.</p>

<p>This was a rosebud of a creature, and she lay in her
grand cradle as if she simply defied even the highest
criticism to dispute the fact. Certainly one who knew
what babies were did not try to do so. Only one remark
was offered at that moment, but to the initiated it was
worth many volumes.</p>

<p>“Whoever’s child it may be,” said Aunt Annie, “and
mind I don’t go into that, it is not a child of common
parents.”</p>

<p class="ph2">IV</p>

<p>For some odd reason, Eliza was so intensely flattered
by Aunt Annie’s words, that she felt a desire to hug
her. None knew so well as Eliza that it was not a child
of common parents, but it was not the way of this
expert to say so. The wonderful creature was “wrapt
in mystery,” but the hallmark of quality must have been
stamped very deep for such a one as Aunt Annie to
commit herself to any such statement. Her standard was
princes and princesses. Every babe in Christendom was
judged thereby, and there was perhaps one in a million
that could hope to survive the test.</p>

<p>A miracle had happened, but it was really too much to
expect that the cradle would have a share in it. Aunt
Annie shook her head over the cradle. It had too many
fal-lals. She approved neither its curtains nor its air of
grandeur. She was a believer in plainness and simplicity.
If before incurring an unwarrantable expense,
her niece had only mentioned the matter, the great lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
would have gone to Armitt’s personally and have
arranged for a replica of the hygienic but unpretentious
design supplied by that famous firm to the Nursery over
which she had presided.</p>

<p>Eliza, however, could accept no responsibility for the
cradle. Harriet had sent it that morning quite unexpectedly.
Aunt Annie was a little surprised that the
taste of Bridport House in cradles was not a little surer.
Yet upon thinking the matter over she found she was
less surprised than she thought she was. The Dinnefords
were a good family, the Duke was esteemed, his
late Duchess, for a brief period, had been Mistress of
the Posset, but after all Bridport House was not Bowley.
After all a Gulf was fixed.</p>

<p>It was vain for Eliza to show how disappointed Harriet
would be; the cradle had so clearly cost a great
deal of money. It had cost too much money, that was
the head and front of the cradle’s offending. There
was an air of the parvenu about it. Such a cradle would
never have been tolerated at Bowley, nay, it was open to
doubt whether it would have been tolerated at Bridport
House.</p>

<p>Aunt Annie was still discoursing upon cradles out of
a full mind, when Harriet herself came on the scene.
She was spending a few days at Number Five, Beaconsfield
Villas before going down to Buntisford, and she had
now returned from a day’s shopping in London. She
knew that Aunt Annie was coming to tea, yet in spite
of being forewarned, the sight of the dominant old lady
seated at the table seemed to dash her at once.</p>

<p>For one thing, perhaps they were not the greatest of
friends. It may have been that Bowley set too high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
a value upon itself in the eyes of Bridport House, it
may have been that Bridport House held itself too independent
in the eyes of Bowley. The clan Sanderson,
one and all, revered Aunt Annie; there was no gainsaying
that her career had been immensely distinguished;
but at this moment Harriet’s greeting certainly seemed
just a little perfunctory; it might even be said to have
a covert antagonism.</p>

<p>Harriet’s health was tenderly inquired after, she was
solemnly congratulated on her recent appointment, which
did her much credit and conferred honor upon her
family; but it was soon apparent that there was only
one subject, to which, at that moment, Harriet could
give her mind. Had she been the mother of the babe,
instead of the godmother merely, her impatience to draw
aside the curtains of the cradle could hardly have been
greater, or her delight in looking upon a ravishing spectacle
when she had done so.</p>

<p>Even the stern criticism of those curtains she did not
heed, until she had gazed her fill. It was a babe in
a million. And when at last she was up against the
curtains, so to speak, instead of meeting the curtains
fairly and squarely, she began to paint extravagant pictures
of the future.</p>

<p>Her name was Mary. That was settled. She was
to be brought up most carefully; indeed, it was decided
already that she was to have a first-rate education.</p>

<p>“A first-rate education!” There was a slight curl
of a critical lip.</p>

<p>“Why not?” inquired godmother Harriet.</p>

<p>“The expense, my dear!”</p>

<p>“I think I shall be able to afford it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“<i>You</i>, my dear,” said Aunt Annie, rather pointedly.</p>

<p>“I am the godmother,” said Harriet, with the light of
battle in her eyes.</p>

<p>“So I hear. But don’t forget she is to be the child
of a police constable.”</p>

<p>“She is not the child of a police constable,” said Harriet,
with a mounting color.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whose child she is. That is a question
I prefer to avoid. But in my humble opinion it
will be a grave mistake to educate her above the class to
which it has pleased Providence to call her. No good
can come of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense!” The fine voice had a slight tremble
in it.</p>

<p>Aunt Annie looked down her large nose. “At any
rate, that has always been my view. And it has always
been the view of, I will not say who. It is very perilous
to tamper with the order of Divine Providence. And
I am surprised that one who has been called to a position
of high responsibility should think otherwise.”</p>

<p>The quick flush upon Harriet’s cheek showed that the
old lady had got home. She was always formidable
at close quarters; even Harriet had to be wary in trying
a fall with her.</p>

<p>“The child must have a good, sensible upbringing.
Let her be taught cooking, sewing, plain needlework, and
so on. And <i>I</i> shall be very glad to give a little advice
from time to time. But I repeat it will be most unwise
to set her up, no matter who her parents may be, above
the station in life to which it has pleased Providence
to call her.”</p>

<p>Again the light of battle darkened the eyes of Harriet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“It is early days at present to talk about it,” she
said. And she laughed suddenly in a high-pitched key.</p>

<p class="ph2">V</p>

<p>Water flowed under London Bridge. The flight of
time demanded that Mary should fulfill her promise of
being the most wonderful child ever seen. She did not
fail, but grew in grace and beauty like a flower. At the
date of her arrival her age was deemed to be one month.
By the time it had been multiplied by twelve a personality
had begun to emerge, twelve months later it was
possible to gauge it.</p>

<p>There never was such a child. Eliza held that opinion
from the first, and godmother Harriet shared it. Aunt
Annie was more discreet, but her actions expressed an
interest of the highest kind. From the moment she had
committed herself to the memorable statement that
“Whoever’s child she may be, she is not a child of common
parents,” there was really no more to be said.
But as the months passed and Mary became Mary yet
more definitely, the old lady, to the astonishment of both
her nieces, began to identify herself intimately with the
fortunes of the creature.</p>

<p>The critical age of two was safely passed. And the
age of three found Mary more than ever the cynosure
of Number Five, Beaconsfield Villas. The infant had
such health, her eyes were so blue, her laugh was so
gay, her rose-bloom tints were so dazzling, that the
childless hearth of the Kellys’ was somehow touched
with the hues of Paradise. In moments of gloom Joe
had his doubts, and now and again expressed them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
He had certainly done very wrong, the whole matter
was most irregular, but the look in Eliza’s face was a
living contradiction to official pessimism.</p>

<p>In the meantime Aunt Annie sat many an hour, spectacles
on nose, making “undies” for her new niece.
The old lady was much courted by the rest of her
family. Even amid the remoter outposts of the clan,
her word was law. Apart from the romance of her
career, she enjoyed a substantial pension, she owned
house property, and the stocking in which she kept her
savings was known to be a long one. But beyond all
things was the woman herself. It was sheer weight of
character that gave her such a special place among her
peers.</p>

<p>The clan Sanderson was extensive, and inclined to
exclude. There were Sandersons holding positions of
trust in various parts of London and the country. There
was Mr. George Sanderson, who was in a bank at Surbiton,
who, if he did not actually share the apex with
his cousin Annie, was immensely looked up to; there
was Francis, who, from very small beginnings, had
blossomed into a chartered accountant; there was young
Lawrence, of the new generation, who had given up
being a page boy in very good service, for the lures
of journalism. He was far from being approved by his
Aunt Annie, and he had not the sanction of his Uncle
George, but he was understood to be doing very well,
and if he only kept on long enough and made sufficiently
good in this eccentric way of life, the mandarins
of the family might regard him a little more hopefully.
Finally, there was Harriet. Hers was a truly remarkable
case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>At the age of twenty-nine, without special training
or any particular influence, she had been made housekeeper
to the Duke of Bridport at Buntisford Hall,
Essex. The more modern minds among the clan might
affect to despise a success of that kind, but for generations
there had been a sort of feudal connection between
the great house of Dinneford and the honest
race of yeomen who had served it. Chartered Accountant
Francis might smile in a superior way, young
Lawrence of Fleet Street, a perfect anarchist of a fellow,
might scoff, but every true-blue Sanderson of the older
generation was amazed at Harriet’s achievement, and
felt a personal pride in it.</p>

<p>Aunt Annie, who had a temperamental dislike of Harriet,
was the first to admit that the rise of her niece had
been very remarkable. The august Miss Sanderson
was an unequaled judge of what Mr. George Sanderson
called “general conditions.” Her own historical
career had given her peculiar facilities for gauging the
lie of a country, socially speaking, her sense of values
was absolutely correct, and she was constrained to admit,
much as it hurt her to do so, that Harriet’s success
had no parallel in her experience.</p>

<p>Eliza Kelly occupied a very different place in the
hierarchy. She was perilously near the base of the
statue. Her brothers, her sisters, her uncles, her cousins,
and her aunts, had always made a practice of going
up in the world, but she had unmistakably come down
in it. It was not that they had anything against Joe
personally. He was sober, honest, a good husband, and
he well knew the place allotted to him by an all-wise
Providence. But when the best had been said for him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
he was not, and could never hope to be, a Sanderson.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, the more surprising that Aunt Annie
should take so great an interest in the waif that the
Kellys had adopted. None knew the name of its parents,
none so much as ventured to hint at the source of its
origin, yet the mandarin-in-chief accepted it as soon as
she set eyes upon it, and month by month, year by year,
to the increasing surprise of the clan as a whole, her
regard for the creature waxed in ever growing proportions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Francis&mdash;A Miss Best, of Sheffield&mdash;had given an
account of her afternoon call at Bowley, which she
had timed as usual for the day after Royalty had paid
its annual visit. Mrs. F.&mdash;in the family, she was always
Mrs. F.&mdash;had then seen Mary for the first time. And
although she had five of her own, the child had made a
great impression. She was like a fairy, with vivid eyes
and wonderful hair, which Aunt Annie used to brush
over a stick every time she came to Croxton Park
Road; her clothes were simple and in perfect taste, but
of a style and quality far beyond the reach of Mrs.
F.’s own progeny. She was then a little more than
three, and not only Mrs. F., but <i>others</i>, according to
Aunt Annie’s account of the matter, had been greatly
struck by her. She certainly made a picture with her
dainty limbs, her laughing eyes, her flaxen curls. All
the same, it was very absurd that the child should
be turned out in that way. Eliza and Joe could not
possibly afford it, and if the old lady was responsible,
as was feared was the case, she ought to have had more
sense than to set her up in that way.</p>

<p>As the result of inquiries, Mrs. F. felt bound to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
make in the matter, and there were very few matters
in which Mrs. F. did not feel bound to make inquiries
of one kind or another, it appeared that Aunt Annie
was not responsible for her clothes. The clothes lay at
the door of godmother Harriet. She had insisted on
choosing them, and had further insisted on sharing the
considerable expense they involved. Mrs. F. gathered
that in the opinion of Aunt Annie and also in that of
Eliza, godmother Harriet was inclined to abuse her
position. She was always insisting. No detail of the
creature’s upbringing escaped her interference. She
must have her say in everything; indeed, she came over
from Buntisford regularly once a week for the purpose
of having it. At Beaconsfield Villas, and also at Bowley,
she took a very high tone, which Eliza and Aunt
Annie strongly resented. But it seemed there was no
remedy. Harriet was the godmother, she had her rights,
her will was as imperious as Aunt Annie’s own&mdash;and
her purse seemed fathomless.</p>

<p>As soon as Mary was four, it was settled that she
should go every morning to Bowley to be taught her
letters. And she must be taken there by a girl “who
spoke nicely.” It seemed that a girl, who spoke nicely,
was a rather rare bird in Laxton. At any rate Eliza
having been compelled in the first place to yield to a
nursemaid, had many to review before one was found
whose style of delivery could satisfy the fastidious ear
of Aunty Harriet.</p>

<p>Eliza might be piqued by such “officiousness,” but she
could not deny that Harriet had reason on her side. Perhaps
it was overdoing things a bit for people in their
position, but Eliza, if fallen from high estate, was still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
at heart a Sanderson. Therefore she knew what was
what. And the secret was hers that the child’s real home
was a long way from Number Five, Beaconsfield Villas,
Laxton. Eliza could never quite forget the source of
origin of her adopted daughter.</p>

<p>Every month that went by seemed to make it increasingly
difficult to forget that. Princess Geraldine herself,
that figure of legend who used to call at Bowley
every twenty-sixth of March, could never have been
in more devout or judicious hands than little Mistress
Mary in that of the Council of Three, not to mention
those of Miss Sarah Allcock, specially coöpted.
No child so tended and cared for, whose welfare was
so carefully studied by experts, could have failed to
grow in beauty and grace. She was so perfectly charming
and superb when in the charge of the discreet Miss
Allcock, she took the air with her wonderful hair, her
patrician features and her white socks, that the nearest
neighbors began to resent it. It was considered rather
swank on the part of the Kellys to set up such a child
at all. They were surprised that Joe, a popular man,
should not have a truer sense of the fitness of things.
They were less surprised at Mrs. Joe, who was not
quite so popular. But Joe was a sensible fellow, and
he should have seen to it that the child did not become
the talk of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, it may not have been so much the fault
of Joe or of Eliza, his wife, that the child became the
talk of the neighborhood. In the purview of local
society, whose salon was Mrs. Connor’s, the greengrocer’s
lady, at the end of the street, the blame lay
at the door of Miss Sarah Allcock. The truth was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
incursion of Miss Allcock was keenly resented by the
local ladies. She was altogether too fine&mdash;yet the odd
thing was that she was not fine at all. But she was
in every way uncommonly superior. No greater tribute
could have been paid to the social supremacy of the presiding
genius of Croxton Park Road, or to the strength
of character of Aunty Harriet, than that such a one
as Miss Allcock should condescend to Beaconsfield Villas.
Truth to tell, Miss Allcock was a remote connection of
the clan Sanderson, although never admitted as such by
the mandarins. But she knew there were strings to
pull, and a good place had been guaranteed her when she
really started out in service.</p>

<p>All the same, as far as the neighbors were concerned,
Miss Sarah Allcock was an error of judgment. She was
amazingly neat and trim, she had the true Sanderson
refinement of manner and address, she was fond of
airing her voice to her charge with all sorts of subtle
Mayfair inflections, and she looked <i>away</i> from the neighbors
as if they were dirt. As if they were dirt&mdash;that
was the gravamen of their complaint in the sympathetic
ear of Mrs. Bridgit Connor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridgit Connor, the greengrocer’s wife, was a
widespread lady of Irish descent, of great but fluctuating
charm, and unfailing volubility. Her vocabulary was
immense, but scorn often taxed it. Her scorn of Miss
Allcock taxed it to the breaking point. Born on a
bog and descended in the remote past from the kings of
the earth, Mrs. Connor had facilities of speech and gesture
denied to the common run of her kind. She avenged
the slights put by Miss Allcock upon herself and friends
by alluding to that lady’s charge in a loud voice whenever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
opportunity offered as “a by-blow,” or “a no-man’s
child.”</p>

<p>When Mary was five there arose the grand question
of her education proper. At first a great clash of wills
was threatened. Aunt Annie had her views. Aunty
Harriet had hers. Eliza, being merely “the mother,” was
not allowed to have any. Aunty Harriet thought perhaps
the kindergarten. Aunt Annie did not believe in such
new-fangled nonsense. Besides no kindergarten would
take her.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Aunty Harriet. But as she spoke
there came a slight flush to the proud face.</p>

<p>“Because they won’t,” said Aunt Annie with stern
finality. “All schools of the better sort are very particular.”</p>

<p>Aunty Harriet bit her lip sharply. She retorted, perhaps
unwisely, that if they were not very particular
they would cease to be schools of the better sort.</p>

<p>“Quite so,” said Aunt Annie.</p>

<p>For the moment it looked as if daggers were going
to be drawn. These two were always at the verge of
conflict. Both were impatient of any kind of opposition,
and in the matter of young Mistress Mary they seldom
saw eye to eye. Aunt Annie did not disguise her opinion
that Aunty Harriet was inclined to take too much upon
herself, and Aunty Harriet had no difficulty in returning
the compliment.</p>

<p>But Harriet had great common sense, and she was
a woman of action. She was not the one tamely to
accept the decree about schools of the better sort, but
began to make researches of her own into the subject.
She was very hard to please, both in regard to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
style of the school and the condition of the scholars,
and when at last one had been found which met the
case, there arose the difficulties Aunt Annie had predicted.
A child of parentage unknown, adopted by the
family of a police constable, did not commend herself
to the Misses Lippincott of Broadwood House Academy.
To Aunty Harriet this seemed a great pity; the school
presided over by those ladies was exactly suitable. Its
tone was high but not pretentious; the small daughters
and the smaller sons of Laxton’s leading tradesmen
mingled with those of its professional classes, and its
reputation was so good that Aunty Harriet, after a discreet
interview with the elder Miss Lippincott, a bishop’s
daughter and a university graduate, set her mind upon it.</p>

<p>Howbeit, the austere Miss Lippincott showed no inclination
to receive the adopted child of a police constable
as a pupil at Broadwood House Academy. This was not
conveyed to Miss Harriet Sanderson in so many words,
but in the course of the next day she received a letter,
delicately-worded, to that effect. However, she did not
give in, as smaller and weaker people might have done,
but she put her pride in her pocket and, looking the
facts in the face, went to take counsel at Bowley.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you, my dear!” said Aunt Annie.
To refrain from that observation would have been superhuman.
But the observation duly made, the old lady
also revealed the divine gift of common sense. From
all that she had heard the establishment of the Misses
Lippincott was immensely desirable. Moreover, she
clearly remembered the Bishop, their late father, coming
to spend the week-end at the real Bowley, and hearing
him preach a singularly moving sermon in the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
parish church. Small wonder, then, that the tone of
Broadwood House Academy was “exactly right” in every
human particular; besides, Aunt Annie had met and
approved Miss Priscilla Lippincott on two occasions.
Therefore, the old lady promised Aunty Harriet that she
herself would see what could be done in the matter.</p>

<p>The first thing Aunt Annie did was to induce the
Mayoress, Mrs. Alderman Bradbury, to say a word on
the child’s behalf. She promptly followed up this piece
of strategy by ordering her state chariot to drive Mistress
Mary and herself to Broadwood House Academy.</p>

<p>The child was looking her best. Her carefully-brushed
tresses shone like woven sunbeams, her slight, trim form
was clothed with taste and elegance, her laughing eyes
were frankly unabashed by the demure Miss Priscilla,
nay, even by the august Miss Lippincott herself. The
effect she made was entirely favorable. Besides, the
Mayoress had taken the trouble to call the previous afternoon
in order to speak for her, and Miss Sanderson,
as the Misses Lippincott knew, was looked up to in Laxton;
therefore, out of regard for all the circumstances,
a point was waived and little Miss Kelly was reluctantly
admitted to Broadwood House Academy.</p>

<p class="ph2">VI</p>

<p>The Misses Lippincott never had cause to rue their
temerity. Little Miss Kelly remained in their care until
she was big Miss Kelly, a brilliant and dashing creature
with a quite extraordinary length of black stocking.
Neither Miss Lippincott nor Miss Priscilla ever regretted
her democratic action. In fact, it was a source of jealous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
remark, even among the most distinguished scholars of
Broadwood House Academy, that not one of them could
wear the black beaver hat with the purple ribbon and its
gold monogram B. H. A., or the blue ulster with gilt buttons,
in quite the way that these modish emblems were
worn by Mary Kelly.</p>

<p>It greatly annoyed Ethel Cliffe, who lived in The
Park, and was a daughter of Sir Joseph, three times
Mayor of Laxton, that in looks and popularity she had
to yield to the offspring of very much humbler parents,
who lived in quite an obscure part of the borough. But
it had to be. Year by year the cuckoo that had entered
the nest grew in beauty and favor, while the legitimate
denizens of Broadwood House could only bite their lips
and marvel. In the opinion of Ethel Cliffe and her
peers, old Dame Nature must be a perfect idiot not to
know her business a bit better.</p>

<p>It was not that Mary Kelly made enemies. Her
disposition was open, free, and fearless; her heart was
gold. Then, too, in most things, she was amazingly
quick. She never made any bones about reading, writing,
arithmetic, geography, and so on, she was good at
freehand drawing, and the use of the globes, in Swedish
drill and ball games, particularly at hockey, she was
wonderful, and in music and dancing there was none
in the school to compare with her. The only things in
which she did not really excel were plain needlework
and religious knowledge. These bored her to tears&mdash;except
that she proudly reserved her tears for matters
which seemed of more consequence.</p>

<p>As Mary Kelly’s stockings got longer and longer the
supremacy of Ethel Cliffe grew even less secure. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
at Broadwood House Academy it was impossible to subsist
entirely on your social eminence. Ethel had openly
sneered at the outsider upon her first intrusion in the
fold; the only daughter of a very recent knight found it
hard to breathe the same air as the offspring of a humble
police constable. But Dame Nature, in her ignorant way,
bungled the whole thing so miserably, that while Ethel
was always very near the bottom of the class, Mary
was generally at the top of it; Ethel was heavy and
humorless, and inclined to take refuge in her dignity,
Mary was <i>bon enfant</i>, with very little in the way of dignity
in which to take refuge. And in proof of that, a
story was told of her, soon after she passed the age of
ten, which ran like wildfire throughout Broadwood
House Academy.</p>

<p>It seemed that in the vicinity of Mary’s undistinguished
home were certain rude boys. Foremost among
them was Mrs. Connor’s Michael, the youngest and not
the least vocal of her numerous progeny. And it often
happened that Michael was <i>en route</i> from his own seat of
learning, where manners did not appear to be in the curriculum,
when Mistress Mary was on the way home
from Broadwood House Academy, where manners undoubtedly
were. In the opinion of Michael’s mother the
Connors were quite as good as the Kellys&mdash;very much
better if it came to that!&mdash;and this tradition had been
freely imbibed by her youngest hope. The Connors were
quite as good as the Kellys, Michael was always careful to
inform his peers, but the haughty beauty of Beaconsfield
Villas, in her beaver hat and blue ulster with gilt
buttons did not share that view. She had simply not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
so much as a look for Michael and his friends. This
aloofness galled them bitterly.</p>

<p>Had she only known such aristocratic indifference
was rather cruel. For Michael’s one distinction among
his mates, apart from his skill as a marble-player, which
was very considerable, was that he lived in the same
street as Miss Kelly. She was out and away the most
wonderful creature ever seen in that part of Laxton.
It was hard to forgive her for carrying her head in the
way she did, yet it somehow added still greater piquancy
to a personality that simply haunted the manly bosoms of
the neighborhood. But her aloofness was felt to be such
a reflection upon Michael himself, that at last that warrior
was moved to a desperate course.</p>

<p>He took the extreme measure of offering Miss Kelly
his best blood alley. But it was in vain; Miss Kelly
would have none of his best blood alley, or of its owner.
Michael then decided upon war.</p>

<p>In discussing the Kellys on the domestic hearth,
he had heard his mother cast grave doubts upon the
ancestry of their so-called daughter. Therefore, the
spirit of revenge, rankling in Michael’s tormented breast,
urged him to adopt a certain rhyme, current at the time,
for the chastening of this haughty charmer. Together
with a few chosen braves he lay in ambush for her as
she wended her proud way home from Broadwood
House Academy. As soon as Mary Kelly hove in sight
round the corner of Grove Street, S.E., these heroes
burst into song:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>On the occasion of the first performance, Miss Kelly
did not deign to take the slightest notice. But after
it had been repeated a number of times with increasing
<i>réclame</i>, it grew more than she could brook. One
never-to-be-forgotten Friday evening, in the fall of the
year, she suddenly handed her satchel of books to her
friend, Rose Pierce, and with decks cleared for action
and the flame of battle in her eyes, bore down upon the
foe. Michael Conner afterwards took his book oath to
the effect that he was not a coward. But the beaver hat,
the purple ribbon, the blue ulster and the gilt buttons
put the fear of God into him very surely. He ran. Alas,
he was a stocky youth, not exactly an Ormonde, even in
his best paces, whereas Mary Plantagenet, black stockings
and all, moved like a thoroughbred. She chased him
remorselessly the whole length of Longmore Street,
through the Quadrant, finally cornered him in a blind
alley in which he had the bad judgment to seek refuge,
and soundly boxed his ears.</p>

<p>As far as Mary Kelly was concerned the incident was
closed from that moment. Michael Connor very wisely
decided to close it also. He returned to his marble-playing
a chastened boy. But Rose Pierce, the daughter
of Laxton’s leading physician, told the story breathlessly
at Broadwood House Academy on the following morning.
All agreed that the prestige of the school had been
seriously impaired, but Miss Kelly was Mary Plantagenet
from that time on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p class="ph2">VII</p>

<p>By the time Mary was fourteen, Broadwood House
Academy had taught her most of what it knew. Then
arose the question of her future. The Kellys were
people in humble circumstances, and it was felt that the
child must be put in the way of getting a living. Eliza
suggested a shop, Aunt Annie shorthand and typewriting,
as she was so quick at her books, but Aunty Harriet
vetoed them promptly. And as year by year that autocrat&mdash;promoted
since the Duke’s breakdown in health
to the very important post of housekeeper at Bridport
House, Mayfair&mdash;had supported the operations of a
strong will with an active power of the purse, she
carried the day as usual. Mary must be a hospital nurse.</p>

<p>To this scheme, however, there was one serious drawback.
No hospital would admit her for training until she
was twenty-one. The problem now was, what she should
do in the meantime. In order to meet it the Misses Lippincott
allowed her to stay on as a special pupil at Broadwood
House. Paying no fees, she gave a hand with the
younger children, and was able to continue the study of
music, for which she showed a special aptitude.</p>

<p>For a time this plan answered very well. The Misses
Lippincott had a great regard for Mary. In every way
she was a credit to the school. Her natural gifts were
of so high an order that these ladies felt that a career
was open to her. There was nothing she might not
achieve if she set her mind upon it, always excepting
plain needlework and religious knowledge, and perhaps
freehand drawing, in which she was a little disappointing
also. Brimming with vitality and the joy of life and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
yet with her gay enthusiasm was now coming to be
mingled a certain ambition.</p>

<p>As month by month she grew into a creature of charm
and magnetism, she seemed to learn the power within
herself. But that discovery brought the knowledge that
she was a bird in a cage. The daily round began to pall.
A rare spirit had perceived bars. Broadwood House
Academy was dear to her, but she now craved a larger,
a diviner air.</p>

<p>It chanced that she was to be put in the way of her
desire. Once a week there came to the school a Miss
Waddington, to give lessons in dancing. A pupil of the
famous Madame Lemaire, of Park Street, Chelsea, this
lady was an accomplished, as well as a very knowledgeable
person. From the first she had been greatly attracted
by Mary Kelly. An instructed eye saw at once
that the girl had personality. Not only was it expressed
in form and feature, it was in her outlook, her ideas.
There was a rhythm in all that she did, a poetry in the
smallest of her actions.</p>

<p>This girl was like no other. And Miss Waddington
grew so much impressed that at last came the proud day,
when by permission of the Misses Lippincott, Mary was
taken to Park Street to the academy, in order that her
gifts might be assessed by “Madame.”</p>

<p>The opinion of that famous lady, promulgated in due
course, caused a nine days’ wonder at Broadwood House.
Madame Lemaire, it seemed, had been so much smitten
by the lithe charm of young Miss Kelly, that she offered
to take her in at Park Street and train her free of
charge for three years.</p>

<p>At once the girl grew wild to take her chance. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
meant escape from a life that had already begun to cast
long shadows. But her home people saw the thing in
a very different light. In their opinion there was a
wide gulf between the respectability of Broadwood
House and the licentious freedom of Chelsea. Joe and
Eliza were at one with Aunt Annie and Aunty Harriet
in saying “No” to the proposal.</p>

<p>Mistress Mary, however, was now rising sixteen with
a rapidly developing character of her own. Therefore
she did not let the strength of opposition daunt her.
She set her mind firmly upon Park Street and Madame
Lemaire; and very soon, to the intense surprise and
chagrin of “her relations,” she had contrived to get the
Misses Lippincott on her side.</p>

<p>Very luckily for Mary, those ladies were open-minded
and worldly wise. They saw that the career of a highly-trained
dancer had prospects far beyond those of a half-educated
schoolmistress. Mary was rapidly becoming an
asset of Broadwood House, but the ladies, although perhaps
a little dubious, allowed themselves to be overpersuaded
by Miss Waddington and the girl herself.</p>

<p>There followed a pretty to-do. Aunt Annie was horrified.
Such a career, with all deference to the Misses
Lippincott, hardly sounded respectable. As for Aunty
Harriet, with her usual energy, she made first-hand inquiries
in regard to Madame Lemaire. She found that
the name of that lady stood high in her profession. But
alas! one thing leads to another. Aunty Harriet, who
had a shrewd knack of taking long views, had already
espied the cloven hoof of the theater. It seemed inevitable
that such a girl as Mary should drift towards it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
And of that sinister institution Aunty Harriet had a
pious horror.</p>

<p>Therefore she opposed Park Street sternly. But the
girl fully knew her own mind and meant from the first
to have her way. And she played her cards so well that
she got it somehow. No doubt it was judicious aid from
an influential quarter that finally carried the day. Be
that as it may, in spite of all sorts of gloomy prophecies,
Mary was able to accept an offer which was to change
completely the current of her life.</p>

<p class="ph2">VIII</p>

<p>The move to Chelsea closed an epoch. At once Mary
found herself in a new and fascinating world. Part of
the arrangement with Madame Lemaire was that she
should “live in” at Park Street, and have freedom to
take a fourpenny ’bus on Sundays to Beaconsfield Villas.
This was greatly to Mary’s liking. Chelsea, as she
soon discovered, had an air more rarefied than Laxton;
somehow it had a magic which opened up new vistas.
She had been by no means unhappy at Broadwood
House, her foster-parents had treated her with every
kindness, but she could not help feeling that by comparison
with the new life, the old one was rather deadly.</p>

<p>Of course, it would have been black ingratitude to
admit anything of the kind. Still, the fact was there.
Park Street had a freedom, a gayety, a careless bonhomie
far removed from the austerity of Broadwood House.
Her life had been enlarged. The hours were long, the
work was hard, but her heart was in it, and the novel
charm of her surroundings was a perpetual delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>A month of Park Street brought more knowledge
of the world than a lustrum of Broadwood House.
Madame Lemaire’s establishment was a famous one,
in fact the resort of fashion; to the perceptive Mary the
people with whom she had now to rub shoulders had
real educational value.</p>

<p>The girl was one of a number of articled pupils, who
were taught dancing in order to teach it again. With all
of these she got on well. Immensely likeable herself,
she had an instinct for liking others. And she was now
among a rather picked lot, a little Bohemian perhaps in
the general range of their ideas, but friendly, amusing,
and at heart “good sorts.” Madame knew her business
thoroughly. She seldom erred as to the character and
capacity of those whom she chose to help her in return
for a valuable training.</p>

<p>Some of the girls who passed through her hands found
their way on to the stage. Distinguished names were
among them. Indeed, the atmosphere of Park Street
was semi-theatrical. Dancing, elocution, singing, physical
culture, and fencing were the subjects taught at
Madame Lemaire’s academy.</p>

<p>Mary remained nearly three years at Park Street. In
that time she came on amazingly. Awake from the first
to a knowledge of her gifts, she was secretly determined
to use them in the carving out of a career. Broadwood
House had sown the seed of ambition; under the able
tutelage of Madame Lemaire it was to bear fruit. Stimulated
by the outlook of her new friends, soon she began
to feel the lure of a larger life. She craved for self-expression
through the emotions, and all her energies
were bent upon the satisfaction of a vital need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>In the early stages she owed much to Madame Lemaire,
who approved her ambition to the full. Here was
a talent, and that lady did all in her power to fit a brilliant
pupil for the field best suited to it. Unknown to Aunty
Harriet, who still cherished the idea of a hospital at the
age of twenty-one, unknown to Aunt Annie, who would
have been horrified, unknown to Beaconsfield Villas,
Mary with the future always before her, set to work
under the ægis of Madame to make her dreams come
true.</p>

<p>After many diligent months, in the course of which a
singularly dainty pair of feet were reënforced by a very
serviceable soprano, there came the day when she was
given her chance. A theatrical manager, who made a
point of attending the annual display of Madame’s pupils
at the Terpsichorean Hall, was so struck by her abilities
that he offered her an engagement. It was true that it
was merely to understudy in the provinces a small part
in a musical comedy. But it was a beginning, if an humble
one, and its acceptance was strongly advised. It meant
the opening of the magic door at which so many are
doomed to knock in vain. This girl should go far; but
if the new life proved too hard, Madame would be more
than willing for her to return to Park Street as a member
of her staff.</p>

<p>Alarums and excursions followed. Before a decision
could be made the girl felt in honor bound to consult
godmother Harriet. So intensely had that lady the welfare
of Mary at heart, that she never failed to visit
Park Street once a week when in London. There was
a very real bond of sympathy between them, which time
had deepened. Yet hitherto Mary had not ventured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
to disclose the scope and nature of her plans. Alas!
she had now to launch a bolt from the blue.</p>

<p>The blow fell one Wednesday afternoon when Aunty
Harriet came as usual to drink a weekly cup of tea at
Park Street with her adopted niece. Aunty Harriet,
although she prided herself upon being a woman of the
world, was unable to entertain such an idea for a moment.
Years ago it had been decided that Mary was to
be a hospital nurse. But Mary, now a strong-willed
creature of eighteen had made her own decision. For
many a month she had been working hard, unknown to
her friends, in order to seize the chance when it came.
Moreover, she felt within herself that she had found her
true vocation.</p>

<p>Aunty Harriet took a high tone. Three years before
she had met defeat at the hands of this headstrong young
woman in alliance with the Misses Lippincott. In secret,
and for a reason only known to herself, she had never
ceased to deplore that fact. She made up her mind that
she would not be overcome a second time. But she was
quite unable to shake the girl’s determination. And there
was Madame Lemaire to reckon with. Indeed, that
worldly-wise person seconded her clever pupil in the
way the Broadwood House ladies had. Nor was it luck
altogether that for a second time brought the girl such
powerful backing when she needed it most. Behind the
engaging air of simple frankness was a will that nothing
could shake.</p>

<p>The end of the matter was that two powerful natures
came perilously near the point of estrangement. Both
had fully made up their minds. That memorable Wednesday
afternoon saw a veritable passage of arms, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
course of which Mary, her back to the wall, at last threw
down the gage of battle.</p>

<p>Her blunt refusal to submit to dictation came as a
shock to Harriet, whose distress seemed out of all proportion
to its cause. But to her the project was so
demoralizing that she fought against it tooth and nail.
She enlisted Aunt Annie, now very infirm and less active
as a power, and the girl’s home people at Beaconsfield
Villas. But all opposition was vain. The young Amazon
had cast the die for better or for worse. To Harriet’s
consternation she took the manager’s offer. Disaster
was predicted. There were heavy hearts in Laxton, but
the heaviest of all was at Bridport House, Mayfair.</p>

FLOWING WATER</h2></div>

<p class="ph2">I</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n</span> a spring afternoon, Mary at ease, novel in lap,
let her mind flow over the years in their passing.
Four had gone by since she had defied
her family, in order to embrace a career, which in their
view was full of peril. But in spite of that, so far she
had escaped disaster. And fortune had been amazingly
kind in the meantime.</p>

<p>On the table near Mary’s elbow were five cups on a
tray, and opposite, also at ease, with her hands behind
her shrewd head, was Milly Wren. Mary had just begun
to share a very comfortable flat with Milly and Milly’s
mother.</p>

<p>Milly herself, in Mary’s opinion, was more than
worthy of her surroundings. Loyal, sympathetic, full
of courage, she had served a far longer apprenticeship
to success than Mary had. She had “made good” in the
face of heavy odds.</p>

<p>Milly had not a great talent. Force of character and
singleness of aim had brought her to the top, and only
these, as she well knew, would keep her there. But with
Mary it was a different story. All sorts of fairies had
attended her birth. She had every gift for the career<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
she had chosen, moreover, she had them in abundance.
Milly, who had gone up the ladder a step at a time, would
have been more than human had she not envied her
friend the qualities she wore with the indifference of a
regular royal queen.</p>

<p>The clock on the chimney-piece struck four.</p>

<p>“I’m feeling quite excited,” Milly suddenly remarked.</p>

<p>From the depths of the opposite chair came the note
which for six months now had cast a spell upon London.</p>

<p>“He mustn’t know that,” laughed Mary. “Dignity,
my child, touched with hauteur, is the prescription for a
marquis. At least that’s according to the book of the
words.” And she gayly waved the novel she had neglected
for nearly an hour.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sonny,” said Milly Wren, “I wasn’t thinking of
<i>him</i>. I was thinking of the friend he is bringing, who
is simply dying to know you.”</p>

<p>Mary knew this was quite true, for that was Milly’s
way.</p>

<p>“Oh, is he!” If the tone was disdain, its sting was
masked by gentle irony and humor. These airs and
graces didn’t make enemies, they so frankly belonged
to the wonderful Mary Lawrence&mdash;her name in the
theater. That which might have been mere petulance in
a nature thinner of texture, became with her a half-royal
impatience for the more trivial aspects of the
human comedy.</p>

<p>“But I want to see him,” persisted Milly. “Sonny
thinks no end of him.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m sure he’s nice.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think so?” Milly was a little intrigued
by the warmth of the words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“Because Lord Wrexham is charming.”</p>

<p>Milly laughed. The naïve admiration was unexpected,
the slightly too respectful air was puzzling. Milly herself
was so <i>blasé</i> in regard to the peerage that such an
attitude of mind seemed almost provincial. Yet she
would have been the first to own that it was the only
thing about her enigmatic friend which suggested anything
of the kind.</p>

<p>“Sonny says he raves about you.”</p>

<p>“It’s <i>his funeral</i>.” The laugh was honestly gay. “He’ll
be very disappointed, poor lad.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fish.”</p>

<p>“I never fish in shallow waters, Miss Wren.”</p>

<p>“You are the most shameless angler I know. But
you do it so beautifully that people don’t realize what
you are at.”</p>

<p>“Unconsciously&mdash;say unconsciously,” came a flash
from the opposite chair.</p>

<p>“So I used to think. Before I really knew you I
thought everything you said and did just happened so.
But now I am not quite sure that you have not thought
everything out beforehand.”</p>

<p>“Don’t make me out a horror.”</p>

<p>“Anyway you are much the cleverest creature I have
ever met. You are so deep that there is no fathoming
you. Somehow you are not the least ordinary in anything.”</p>

<p>Mary abruptly brought the conversation back to
Sonny and his friend. The latter, it seemed, had first
gazed on the famous Miss Lawrence in New York, at
the Pumpernickel Theater, the previous year.</p>

<p>“An American?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>“No,” said Milly. “But he’s seen a lot of life out
West.”</p>

<p>Before other questions could rise to Mary’s lips, Mrs.
Wren came in. Milly’s mother was an elderly lady who
had been on the stage. In the first flight of her
profession, life had given her many a shrewd knock,
but in the process she had picked up a considerable
knowledge of the world and its ways. She lived for
Milly, in whom her every thought was centered, for in
the daughter the mother lived again. Intensely ambitious
for her, Mrs. Wren was a little inclined to resent
the intrusion within the nest of a bird of such dazzling
plumage as Mary Lawrence. At the same time that
honest woman well knew that her daughter had more
to gain than she had to lose by sharing a roof with such
a supremely attractive stable companion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren found it very difficult to place Mary
Lawrence. In ideas and outlook, in the face she showed
to the world, she was far from being a typical member
of her calling as the good lady knew it. As Mrs. Wren
reckoned success, this girl had won it on two continents
almost too abundantly, but she seemed to hold it very
cheap. Perhaps it had been gained too easily. Milly’s
mother, rather jealous, rather ambitious as she was,
could hardly find it in her heart to say it was undeserved,
but Mary Lawrence took the high gifts of fortune so
much for granted, almost as if they were a birthright,
that the mother of her friend, remembering the long
years of her own thornily-crowned servitude, and Milly’s
hard struggle “to arrive,” could not help a feeling of
secret envy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“His lordship coming to tea?” said Mrs. Wren, with
a demure glance at the five cups on the tray.</p>

<p>None knew so well as she that his lordship was coming
to tea. She had made elaborate preparations in toilette
and confectionery in order to receive him. But the
phrase rose so histrionically to her lips that she simply
couldn’t resist it. Somehow it made such a perfect
entrance, for Milly’s mother carried a sense of the
theater into private life.</p>

<p>It would have been heartless of Milly, who belonged
to another generation, to have uttered the words on her
tongue. And those words were, “You know perfectly
well that Sonny is coming.”</p>

<p>“He said he was,” Milly’s reply was given with a
patient smile that concealed an infinity of boredom.
Her mother, fussy, trite, rather exasperating, had never
quite learned amid all her jousts with the world, to
acquire the golden mean. There were times when she
sorely tried her clever and ambitious daughter, whose
patience was little short of angelic.</p>

<p>“What’s the name of the friend he is bringing?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Dinneford.”</p>

<p>“Not another lord?” The tone of Mrs. Wren had
a tiny note of disappointment.</p>

<p>“A rich commoner,” said Milly with a laugh. “At
least Sonny says he will be one of the richest men in
England when his uncle dies. His uncle, I believe, is a
great swell.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it, dear,” said Mrs. Wren.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p class="ph2">II</p>

<p>An electric bell was heard to buzz.</p>

<p>“They are here,” said Mrs. Wren in a tone with a
thrill in it.</p>

<p>A neat parlor maid announced “Lord Wrexham, Mr.
Dinneford,” and two stalwart young men entered cheerily.
They were hearty upstanding fellows, curiously
alike in manner, appearance, dress, yet in the thousand
and one subtleties of character immutably different.
But this was not a moment for the fine shades. They
came into the room unaffectedly, without shyness, and
warmly took the hands of welcome that were offered
them.</p>

<p>Wrexham, a subaltern of the Pinks of three years’
standing, was an attractive but rather irresolute young
man. He knew that he was perilously near forbidden
ground. If not exactly in the toils of an infatuation,
the charms of Milly were growing day by day upon
an impressionable mind. Fully content as yet to live
in the moment, a wiser young man might have begun
to pay the future some little attention.</p>

<p>As for the lively, headstrong, unconventional Jack
Dinneford, at present at a loose end in London, to whom
Wrexham himself had been appointed as a sort of unofficial
bear-leader by the express desire of Bridport
House, that warrior was on a voyage of discovery. In
common with half the males of his age in the metropolis
he was already in the thrall of the wonderful Princess
Bedalia. In the opinion of connoisseurs she was the
only one of her kind; for the past two hundred nights
she had played “to capacity” at the Frivolity Theater,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
and even Jack Dinneford, who in one way or another
had seen a goodish bit of the Old World and the New,
could not repress an exquisite little thrill as her highness
rose with rare politeness to receive him.</p>

<p>“She’s even more stunning than I guessed,” was the
thought in Jack’s mind at the moment of presentation.
He could almost feel the magnetism in her finger tips.
She was so alive in every nerve that it would have called
for no great power of imagination to detect vibration
all round her.</p>

<p>“I feel greatly honored in meeting you,” said the
young man with transparent honesty. He was no
subscriber evidently to the maxim, “Language was given
us to conceal our thoughts.” Somehow she couldn’t help
liking him for it.</p>

<p>“The honor is mine.” The response was so ready, the
humor behind it so genuine, that they both laughed
whole-heartedly and became friends on the spot. There
was no nonsense about Princess Bedalia, and the same
applied to the brown-faced clear-eyed owner of the
fanciful scarf pin.</p>

<p>The neat parlor maid brought tea. Wrexham, after
a little amiable chaffing of Mrs. Wren, whom he had
met on at least six occasions, provided Milly with tea
and a macaroon, took the like for himself, and sat beside
her without a care in the wide world. She was
forbidden fruit; thus to frail humanity in its present
phase she conveyed an idea of Paradise. Such a view
was quite absurd, allowing even for the fact that Milly
was an engaging creature, with a good heart, a ready
tongue, a rather special kind of prettiness, and a particularly
shrewd head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>Jack Dinneford on the opposite sofa had stronger
warrant for his emotions. This girl whom he had first
seen in New York before the news of a great inheritance
had come to him, whom he had since viewed ten times
from the stalls of the Frivolity Theater, was a personality.
There was no doubt about that. And as he discovered
at once their minds marched together. They
saw men and events at the same angle. A phrase of
either would draw forth an instant counterpart; in five
minutes they had turned the whole universe into mockery,
but without letting go of the fact that they were
complete strangers colloguing for the first time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren withdrew presently on the pretext that
she had letters to write. A very pleasant hour quickly
sped. Each of these four people was in the mood to
enjoy. Life in spite of its hazards, was no bad thing
at the moment. Wrexham, a thorough gentleman, was
an immensely likeable young man. And while he basked
in present happiness a certain resolution began to take
shape in his mind.</p>

<p>As for Jack Dinneford at the other side of the room,
his thoughts followed a humbler course. But he was
an elemental, a very dangerous fellow if once he began
to play with ideas. At present he suffered from the
drawback of being no more than the nephew of his uncle;
therefore his sensations were not exactly those of
Wrexham, who was a natural caster of the handkerchief.
But in this fatal hour Jack was heavily smitten.</p>

<p>He had met few girls in his twenty-four years of
existence. In his naïf way he confessed as much to Miss
Lawrence. She was amused by the confession and led
him to make others. This was easy because he liked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
talking about himself, that is to say, with such a girl
as Mary Lawrence inciting him humorously to reveal
the piquant details of a life not without its adventures, he
would have had to be much less primitive than he was
to have resisted the lure of the charmer.</p>

<p>She was unaffectedly interested. She differed from
Mr. Dinneford inasmuch as she had met many young
men. Therefore, her heart was not worn on her sleeve
for daws to peck at. But he was a new type, and she
confessed gayly to Milly as soon as he had gone, she
found him very amusing.</p>

<p class="ph2">III</p>

<p>So much happened in the crowded month that followed,
that at London Bridge the Thames might be
said to be in spate. The two young men were often
at the theater, and now and again Mary and Milly,
chaperoned by Mrs. Wren, would accept an invitation
to supper at a restaurant. Then there were the happy
hours these four people were able to snatch from their
various duties, which they spent under the trees in the
Park. These were golden days indeed, but&mdash;the shadow
of the policeman could already be seen creeping up.
The senior subaltern had been constrained one fine
morning to take Wrexham so far into his confidence as
to inform him with brutal precision, that if a man in
the Household Cavalry marries an actress, he leaves the
regiment.</p>

<p>The young man was intensely annoyed. Wisdom was
not his long suit, and although an excellent fellow
according to his lights, right at the back was the arrogance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
of old marquisate. His answer to the senior subaltern
was to arrange a most agreeable up-river excursion
for the following Sunday. On returning late
in the evening to the flat, Milly was in rather a flutter.</p>

<p>Mary, who had been one of the merry party, was
troubled. She had certain instincts which went very
deep, and these warned her of breakers ahead. She
had a great regard for Milly, and the more she knew
of Wrexham the better she liked him. But she saw
quite clearly that difficulties must arise if the thing went
on, and that very powerful opposition would have to
be faced in several quarters.</p>

<p>Moreover, she had now her own problem to meet;
Jack had begun to force the pace. And Mary, who
had a sort of sixth sense in these matters, had already
felt this to be an inconvenience. From the first she
had found him delightful. Day by day this feeling had
grown. An original, with a strong will and a keen sense
of humor, he differed from his friend Wrexham inasmuch
that he knew his own mind. He returned from the
river fully determined to marry Mary Lawrence.</p>

<p>Perhaps this heroic resolve may have been forced
upon him by the knowledge of other Richmonds in
the field. Mary was famous and admired. It savored
of presumption for such a one as himself, in receipt
of a modest two thousand a year from his kinsman, the
Duke, to butt in where men far richer were content to
walk delicately. But he was “next in” at Bridport
House, he was heir to a great name, therefore, at the
lowest estimate, he was a quite considerable <i>parti</i>. This
fact must stand his excuse, although he was far too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
astute to make it one in the difficult game he was about
to play.</p>

<p>Jack was not afflicted with subtlety in any form, he
was not even a close observer, but he understood well
enough that it was going to be a man’s work to persuade
Mary Lawrence to marry him. She had an immense
independence, to which, of course, she was fully entitled,
a wide field of choice, and under the delightfully
amusing give-and-take which endeared her to Bohemia
was a fastidious reserve which somehow hinted at
other standards. Even allowing for a lover’s partiality
this girl was to cut to a pattern far more imposing than
Milly Wren. Her qualities were positive, whereas Milly
had prettiness merely, a warm heart, a factitious charm.
However, as soon as this sportsman had made up his
mind to tackle the stiffest fence that a Nimrod has to
face, he decided at once that the hour had come to
harden his heart and go at the post and rails in style.</p>

<p>The next evening, as he strolled with Mary under the
trees, he may have been thinking in metaphor, when he
let his eyes dwell on the riders in the Row.</p>

<p>“How jolly they look!” he said. And then at the
instance of a concrete thought&mdash;“By Jove, an idea!
Tomorrow morning, if I job a couple of gees, will you
come for a ride?”</p>

<p>The response was a ready one. “I should love to,
if you are not afraid to be seen with an absolute duffer.”</p>

<p>“That’s a bargain. But they may be screws, as there
doesn’t seem enough decent ones to go round at this
time of the year.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about horses,” was the laughing
reply, “except just enough not to look a hired horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
in the knees. And the worse my mount the better for
me, at least it reduces my chance of biting the tan.”</p>

<p>“I expect you are a good deal better than you admit.”</p>

<p>She was woman enough to ask why he should think
so.</p>

<p>“You have the look of a goer,” he said, as his eye
sought involuntarily the long slender line of a frame
all suppleness, delicacy, and power.</p>

<p>“Wait till tomorrow. In the meantime I warn you
that you’re almost certain to be disgraced in the sight
of the town.”</p>

<p>“Let’s risk it anyway,” said the young man delightedly.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes, however, Mary seriously
regretted a rash promise. They had only gone a few
yards farther, Jack still inclined to exult at the pact into
which he had lured her, when both were brought up
short by a sudden clear “Hello!” from the other side
of the rails.</p>

<p>Jack had been hailed by a couple of long, lean young
women with mouse-colored hair, on a couple of long,
lean mouse-colored horses. They were followed at a
respectful distance by a very smart groom on a good-looking
chestnut. The set of the close-fitting black
habits and the absolute ease of the wearers denoted the
expert horse-woman.</p>

<p>“Hello, Madge&mdash;hello, Blanche!” The casual greeting
was punctuated by a wave, equally casual, of the
young man’s hand.</p>

<p>As the two riders went slowly by they let their eyes
rest upon Mary. The look she received did not amount
to a stare, but it had a cool impertinence which somehow
roused her fighting instinct. Unconsciously she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
gave it back. On both sides was a frank curiosity
discreetly veiled, but the honors, if honors there were
in the matter, were with the occupants of the saddle.
Somehow that seemed so clearly to have been the place
for generations of these lean young women with their
rigidity of line, their large noses, their cool appraising
air of which they were wholly unconscious.</p>

<p>Who are <i>they</i>? was their reaction upon Mary Lawrence.</p>

<p>Who is <i>she</i>? was her reaction upon these horsewomen.</p>

<p>“A couple of my cousins.” The young man carelessly
answered a question that Mary was too proud to ask.</p>

<p class="ph2">IV</p>

<p>Mary’s riding had been confined to a few lessons
shared with Milly at the Brompton School of Equitation,
and Milly was urged to make a third on the morrow.
Mrs. Wren felt it to be the due of the proprieties that
she should do so, but Milly herself, apart from the fact
that she was shy of appearing in the Row, was quite convinced
that it would not be the act of “a sport” to overlook
the ancient maxim, “Two are company, three
a crowd.” Therefore the invitation was declined. And
this discreet action on the part of Milly gave Fate the
opportunity for which it had seemed to be looking for
some little time past.</p>

<p>It was about twenty minutes to eleven in the forenoon
of a perfect first of June that Jack Dinneford rode
up gayly to the flat in Broad Place, leading a horse
very likely-looking, but warranted quiet. It was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
fair presumption that the guarantee covered the fact
of its disposition, since it had made the perilous journey
from the jobmaster’s, three doors out of Park Lane,
and across the No Man’s Land yclept Hyde Park
Corner, that terrible and trappy maze, without a suspicion
of mental stress.</p>

<p>Jack’s best hunting voice ascended to an open window
of the second story. The complete horsewoman, in
every detail immaculate, came on to the little balcony
of Number 16, Victoria Mansions.</p>

<p>“What a gorgeous day!”</p>

<p>“A ripper!”</p>

<p>If excitement there was on the side of either, self-mastery
concealed it. Yet an inconvenient pressure of
emotion was shared by both just then. In spite of a liberal
share of self-confidence and a will under strong
control Mary could hardly refrain from the hope that
she was not going to make a perfect fool of herself.
As soon as she beheld the upstanding chestnut below
with its slender legs and thin tail, she winged an involuntary
prayer to Allah that there were no tricks in
its repertory unbecoming a horse and a gentleman.
As for Jack, the presence of all the horses in the world
would not have excited him. It was not in him to be
excited by things of that kind, that is to say, it was
part of his religion not to be excited by them; all the
same there was a genuine, nay, almost terrible thrill in
his heart this morning.</p>

<p>In the course of a rather wakeful night he had made
up his mind “to come to the ’osses” in sober verity.
To the best of his present information the gods, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
absence of the unforeseen, would discuss the matter
privately about twelve o’clock.</p>

<p>“Blanche and Marjorie will have something to look
at,” was the proud thought in the mind of the young
man as the complete Diana, fit to greet Aurora and her
courses, emerged from the Otis elevator and took the
front of Broad Place with beauty.</p>

<p>“I wish these clothes were a little less smart, and not
quite so new,” was the first thought in the mind of
Diana. “I am sure they are both of them ‘Cats,’” was
the thought which followed close upon its heels. Until
that hour it had never been her lot to harbor such vain
companions. This gay spirit to whom the fairies had
been kind had always seemed to breathe a larger, a
diviner air. Such self-consciousness shamed her; but
after all <i>those two</i> with their old habits and their odd
perfection were more to blame than she.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, in the last seventeen hours a subtle,
rather horrid change had taken place in her. Up till
six o’clock the previous evening she had always been
nobly sure of herself, regally self-secure. Always when
she had measured herself against others of her age
and sex she had had a feeling of having been born to the
purple. Somewhere, deep down, she had seemed to
have illimitable reserves to draw upon when the creatures
of her own orbit had forced her to a reluctant
comparison. In all her dealings with her peers, she had
felt that she had a great deal in hand. But Marjorie
and Blanche, whoever Marjorie and Blanche might be,
had seemed to alter all that with a glance of their
ironical eyes.</p>

<p>Jack fixed her in the saddle of the tall horse and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
lengthened her stirrup with quite a professional air,
while Milly and her mother watched the proceedings
in a rather thrilled silence from the balcony of Number
Sixteen. Their minds were dominated by a single
thought, which, however, bore one aspect in the mind
of Mrs. Wren, another in the mind of the faithful Milly.</p>

<p>“She is <i>set</i> on marrying him?”&mdash;Mrs. Wren.</p>

<p>“He is so nice, I hope he won’t disappoint her?”&mdash;Milly
the faithful.</p>

<p>The cavalcade started. As if no such people as
Marjorie and Blanche existed in the world, Mary waved
the yellow-gloved hand of an excited schoolgirl to the
balcony of Victoria Mansions. Jack accompanied it
with an upward glance and a gravely-lifted hat.</p>

<p>In the maelstrom of promiscuous vehicles which
makes Knightsbridge a thoroughfare inimical to man,
Jack took charge of the good-looking hireling. With
solemn care he piloted the upstanding one and his rather
anxious rider into the calm of Albert Gate.</p>

<p>“I hope you are comfortable,” he found time to say;
moreover, he found time to say it so nicely and sincerely,
almost as if his only hope of happiness, here and hereafter,
depended upon the answer, that the answer came
promptly in the form of a gay “Yes,” although had she
been quite honest she would have said she had never
felt less comfortable in her life. Her horse was such a
mountain of a fellow, that she might have been perched
on the top of a very old-fashioned velocipede. Then the
saddle was very different from the one at the riding
school. It had much less room and fewer <i>points d’appui</i>
to offer. As soon as her knee tried to grip the pommel
she knew that she must not hope to get friends with it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
She had embarked on a very rash adventure. And if
she didn’t make a sorry exhibition of herself in the eyes
of All London, including <i>those two</i>, she would have
cause to thank her private stars, who, to give them
their due, had certainly looked after her very well so far.</p>

<p>“It’s very sporting of her,” said Expert Knowledge
to Jack Dinneford.</p>

<p>“I hope the gee won’t play the fool,” said Jack Dinneford
to Expert Knowledge.</p>

<p class="ph2">V</p>

<p>Hardly had they entered the Row, when Providence,
of <i>malice prepense</i>, as it seemed, threw them right across
the path of the enemy. Cousin Marjorie and Cousin
Blanche, walking their horses slowly along by the rails,
were within a very few yards. Moreover, they were
coming towards them. Mary, aided by the sixth sense
given to woman, was aware of a subtle intensity of gaze
upon her, even before she could trace the source of its
origin. She could feel it upon her&mdash;upon her and everything
that was hers, from the crown of her rather too
modish hat to the tip of her tall friend’s fetlock.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Jack,” said a clear, strong voice.</p>

<p>“Hello,” the tone of Jack was amazingly casual&mdash;“here
you are again.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s maneuvering, in the course of
which three pairs of feminine eyes met in challenge,
and then Cousin Blanche and Cousin Marjorie, smart
groom and all, passed on without offering a chance of
coming to closer quarters. Their tactics had been calculated
so nicely that it was impossible to say whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
discourtesy was or was not intended. But there was a
subtle air about these ironically self-confident young
women which prevented Mary from giving them the
benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>For a moment she felt inclined to rage within. And
then she bit her lip and laughed. A moment later a
sudden peck of the tall horse told her that it would be
wise for the present to give him an undivided mind.
Soon, however, Cousin Marjorie and Cousin Blanche
were forgotten in the delights and the perils of the
discreet canter into which she found herself launched.
It was a perfect morning for the Row. The play of
the sun on the bright leaves, the power of its rays
softened by a breeze from the east, the sense of rapid
motion, the kaleidoscope of swiftly changing figures
through which they passed, filled her with a zest of life,
a feeling of high romance which left no room for smaller
and meaner affairs. And the stride of the tall horse,
as soon as she got used to it, was such a thing of delight
in itself, that she even forgot the strange saddle and
her general fears.</p>

<p>They rode for an enchanted hour. And somehow, in
the course of it, the life forces became more insurgent.
Somehow they deepened, expanded, grew more imperious.
Jack was a real out-of-doors man, who believed that
hunting, shooting, field sports, and fresh air were the
highest good. His look of lordly health, mingled with
a charmingly delicate protectiveness, appealed to her in a
very special way. For some weeks she had known that she
was beginning to like him perilously much. But it was
not until she had returned rather tired and rather hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
to Victoria Mansions, had had a delicious bath, and a
very good luncheon indeed that she began at last to
realize that she was fairly up against the acute problem
of Jack Dinneford.</p>

BRIDPORT HOUSE</h2></div>

<p class="ph2">I</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> the meantime Cousin Marjorie and Cousin
Blanche enjoyed their ride very much. It was the
one thing they really did enjoy in London.</p>

<p>They were two ordinary young women, yet even so
late in the Old World’s history as the year 1913, their
own private cosmos could not quite make up its mind
to regard them in that light. Cousin Marjorie and
Cousin Blanche had surprisingly little to say for themselves.
They were modest, unassuming girls, without
views or ideas, very proper, very dull, absurdly conventional;
in the eyes of some people as plain as the proverbial
pikestaff, passably good-looking in the sight of
others; in fact, a more commonplace pair of young women
would have been hard to find anywhere, yet deep in the
hearts of the Ladies Dinneford was the sure faith that
the world at large did not subscribe to any such opinion.</p>

<p>It was not merely that they rode rather well. They
passed other members of their sex in the Row that
morning who rode quite as well as themselves. No,
proficiency in the saddle, the one accomplishment they
could boast, of which they were unaffectedly modest, was
far from explaining the particular angle at which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
world chose to view them. Not that in any way they
were fêted or acclaimed. As far as the vast majority
of their fellow-creatures were concerned they were not
people to look at twice. But here and there a glance
of recognition or curiosity would greet them, winged by
a smile, now of mere interest, now of an irony faintly
perceptible.</p>

<p>Life had been very kind to Cousin Marjorie and
Cousin Blanche, yet they did not look conspicuously
happy. With both hands it had lavished upon them its
material best, but the gifts of fortune were taken as
a matter of mere personal right. Providence owed it
to the order of things they stood for. Far from being
grateful, they were a little bored by its attentions.
Moreover, these young women had not learned to regard
people to whom the fairies had been less kind with either
insight or sympathy. Their judgments were objective,
therefore they were a little hard, a little lacking in tolerance.</p>

<p class="ph2">II</p>

<p>“The stage!” said Marjorie with a straight-lipped smile,
a rather famous part of her importance.</p>

<p>“You think so?” said Blanche sleepily. But she was
not at all sleepy, else she would not have been able to
handle the Tiger, a recent purchase, in the way she was
doing at the moment.</p>

<p>“No mistaking it, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Good-looking, though,” lisped the somnolent Blanche,
giving the Tiger a very shrewd kick with a roweled heel.
“Reminds me of some one.”</p>

<p>The Tiger, worried by a bit that he didn’t like, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
greatly affronted by the heel of his new mistress, which
he liked still less, then began to behave in a way which
for some little time quite forbade any further discussion
of the subject.</p>

<p>For the rest of the morning, however, it was never
far from the minds of these ladies. Two or three times
they caught sight in the distance of Jack and his charge.
A striking-looking girl, but she didn’t in the least know
how to ride. And somehow from that fact Blanche and
Marjorie seemed to draw spiritual consolation.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock they left the Park. The policeman
at the gate pulled himself together and regarded them
respectfully. An elderly lady in a high-hung barouche
of prehistoric design, drawn by a superb pair of horses
and surmounted by a romantic-looking coachman and
footman, called out to them in a remarkably strident
voice as they passed her, “I am coming to luncheon.”</p>

<p>“Bother!” said Marjorie to Blanche.</p>

<p>“Bother!” said Blanche to Marjorie.</p>

<p>They went along Park Lane, as far as Mount Street,
turned up that bleak thoroughfare, took the second turning
to the right, and finally entered the courtyard of the
imposing residence known as Bridport House. Before
its solemn portals they dismounted with the help of the
smart groom. In the act of doing so they encountered
a tall, rather distinguished-looking man, who was coming
down the steps. He was about forty-two, clean-shaven,
with sandy hair; and his clothes had an air of such
extreme correctness as to suggest that they had been
donned for a special occasion.</p>

<p>The departing visitor bowed elaborately to the two
ladies, but each returned the greeting with an abbreviated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
nod, backed by an intent smile peculiarly her own.
There might be courtesy carried to the verge of homage
on the one side, but on the other was an aloofness cold
and quizzical.</p>

<p>As soon as Blanche and Marjorie had gained the
ample precincts of Bridport House each looked demurely
at the other, and then yielded a laugh, which seemed to
mean a great deal more than it expressed.</p>

<p>“Been to see papa, I suppose,” said Blanche, as she
waddled duck fashion towards a white marble staircase
of grandiose design, whose cinquecento air could not
save it from a slight suspicion of the rococo.</p>

<p>“My dear!” came Marjorie’s crescendo.</p>

<p>Again they looked at each other, again their laughter
snarled and crackled not unpleasantly.</p>

<p>At one o’clock luncheon was announced. Ten minutes
later a well-bathed and carefully re-clothed Marjorie
and a Blanche to match entered an enormous dining-room,
which, in spite of its profusion of servants in
livery, had the air of a crypt.</p>

<p>“Good morning, father. Very pleasant to see you
down.”</p>

<p>Each word of Blanche was charmingly punctuated by
a little pause, which might have been taken for filial
regard by those who heard it. But the rather acid-looking
gentleman, who sat at the head of the table,
with a face like a cameo a little out of drawing, and a
bowl of arrowroot in front of him, paid such slight
attention to Blanche that she might not have spoken
at all.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Aunt Charlotte,” said Marjorie coolly,
taking up her own cue. She surveyed the other occupants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
of the table with a quietly ironical eye. And then
as she seated herself at her leisure, as far as she could
get from the object of her remarks, she proceeded in the
peculiar but remarkably agreeable voice which she had
in common with her father and sisters: “Odd we should
run into you coming out of the Park.”</p>

<p>“Why odd?” said Aunt Charlotte, an elderly, large-featured
blonde, whose theory of life was as far as possible
not to cherish illusions on any subject. “I always
go in at twelve, you always come out at twelve. Nothing
odd about it. Thank you!”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” meant, “Yes, I will take claret.” It
also meant, “Get on with your luncheon, Marjorie, and
don’t be absurd. Life is too complicated nowadays for
such small talk as yours to interest an intelligent person.”</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte, if not consciously rude, was by nature
exceedingly dominant. For twenty-five years, in one
way or another, Bridport House had known her yoke.
She was the Duke’s only surviving sister, and she lived
in Hill Street, among the dowagers. Her status was <i>nil</i>,
but her love of power was so great that she had gained
an uncomfortable ascendancy in the family councils.
While free to admire Aunt Charlotte’s wisdom, which
was supposed to be boundless, the Dinneford ladies dislike
her in the marrow of their bones. But Fate had
played against them. Their father had been left a
widower with a young family, and from the hour of his
loss his sister had taken upon herself to mother it. She
had done so to her own satisfaction, but the objects of
her regard bore her no gratitude. From Sarah,
who was thirty-nine, to Marjorie, who was twenty-eight,
they were ever ready to try a fall with Aunt Charlotte.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>As for their father, he had an active dislike of her.
He had cause, no doubt. More than once he had tried
to break the spell of her dominion, but somehow it had
always proved too strong for him. It was not that he
was a weak man altogether, but there is a type born to
female tyranny, an affair of the stars, of human destiny.
Charlotte despised her brother. In her view he was a
lath painted to look like iron, but insight into character
was not her strength. She owed her position in the
family to dynamic power, to force of will; but in her
own mind it was always ascribed to the fact that she
acted invariably from the highest motives.</p>

<p>“Muriel not here,” said the conversational Marjorie,
looking across the table to Sarah.</p>

<p>“Gone to the East End, I believe, to one of her committees.”</p>

<p>It would have been nearer the truth for the eldest
flower, who was dealing with a recalcitrant fragment of
lobster in a masterful manner, to have said that Muriel
had gone to luncheon at Hayes with the Penarths. But
Sarah, who did not approve of Muriel, and still less of
the Penarths, was content with a general statement whose
flagrant inaccuracy somehow crystallized her attitude
towards them both. Muriel had become frankly impossible.
The higher expediency could no longer take her
seriously.</p>

<p>But there are degrees of wisdom, even among the elect.
Sarah’s place was assured at Minerva’s Court, but Marjorie
and Blanche were wiser perhaps in matters equine
than in other things. Where angels feared to tread
Blanche, at any rate, for reasons of her own, had sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
been known to butt in. A classical instance was
about to be furnished.</p>

<p>“Do tell me.” Blanche suddenly looked Sarah
straight in the eyes. “Has Sir Dugald been to see
father?”</p>

<p>There was a long moment’s pause in which Sarah
maintained a stranglehold upon the lobster, while Lady
Wargrave and the Duke, who knew they were being
“ragged” by a past mistress in the art, glared daggers
down the table.</p>

<p>“I believe so,” said Sarah in an exceedingly dry voice,
followed by a hardly perceptible glance at the servants.</p>

<p class="ph2">III</p>

<p>Over the coffee cups, in the solemn privacy of the
blue drawing-room, the Dinneford ladies grew a little
less laconic. They were in a perfect hurricane of great
events. Even they, who seldom use two words if one
would suffice, had to make some concession to the pressure
of history.</p>

<p>“His mother, I understand,” said Aunt Charlotte, seating
herself massively in the center of her floridly
Victorian picture, “kept the village shop at Ardnaleuchan.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ve bought bull’s-eye peppermints of her,” said
Sarah, with a touch of acid humor which somehow
became her quite well.</p>

<p>“But it’s so serious”&mdash;Lady Wargrave stirred her
coffee. “Still he’s been given the Home Office&mdash;so she
thinks she moves with the times, no doubt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Has</i> been given the Home Office?” said Blanche,
suddenly achieving an air of intelligence.</p>

<p>“The papers say so,” said Sarah dryly. “But I don’t
think that excuses him.”</p>

<p>“Or Muriel,” interpolated Aunt Charlotte with venom.
“What did your father say to the man?”</p>

<p>“He was deplorably rude, I believe&mdash;even for father.
He said the man had the hide of a rhinoceros, so obviously
he had tested it.”</p>

<p>“All very amazing. It is charity to assume that Muriel
is out of her mind.”</p>

<p>“One can’t be sure,” said Sarah weightily. “She says
he has such a good head that one day he <i>must</i> be Prime
Minister. After all, she will be a Prime Minister’s
wife!”</p>

<p>“But a Radical Prime Minister’s wife!”</p>

<p>“He may rat,” said Sarah, with judicious optimism.</p>

<p>“He may,” said Lady Wargrave, looking down her
long nose. “But there never was a matter in which I
felt less hopeful. What does your father think?”</p>

<p>“The man’s a red rag. Don’t you remember the
shameful way he attacked poor father on the Land
Question two years ago? What was it he called him in
the House of Commons?”</p>

<p>“‘The Great Panjandrum, with little round button on
top,’” quoted the solemn Marjorie, whose chief social
asset was an amazing memory.</p>

<p>“And after that he dares to come here!” Aunt Charlotte
quivered majestically. “Didn’t your father kick
him downstairs?”</p>

<p>“I think he would have done&mdash;but for his infirmity,”
said Sarah judicially.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“I had forgotten his gout, poor man. At least, I
hope he ordered the servants to throw the creature into
the street.”</p>

<p>“One hardly does that, does one?&mdash;with his Majesty’s
Secretaries of State,” said Blanche, whose sleepy voice
had an odd precision which made each word bite like an
acid.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte hooded her eyes like a cobra to look
at Blanche. But she didn’t say anything. Only experts
could handle Blanche, and even these must abide the
whim of the goddess opportunity.</p>

<p>“After all, why fuss?” continued Blanche with a muted
laugh which had the power of annoying all the other
ladies extremely. “If one has to marry one might as
well marry a Prime Minister.”</p>

<p>This was such a sublime expression of the obvious,
that even Lady Wargrave, who contested everything on
principle, was dumb before it. Blanche was therefore
able to retire in perfect order to the comatose, her natural
state. But in the next moment she reëmerged, so that
a little private thunderbolt she had been diligently nursing
through the whole luncheon might shake the rather
strained peace of the blue drawing-room. She was quite
sure that it would be a pleasure to launch it when the
moment came. A sudden pause in the great topic of
Muriel’s <i>affaire</i> told her it had now arrived.</p>

<p>“We saw Jack riding with that girl.” So sleepy was
the voice of Blanche as it made this announcement that
it seemed a wonder she could keep awake.</p>

<p>“What girl?” Aunt Charlotte walked straight into
Blanche’s little trap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, you <i>didn’t</i> know.” Blanche suppressed a yawn.
“It’s a rather long story.”</p>

<p>Still it had to be told. And Blanche, just able to keep
awake, told it circumstantially. The Tenderfoot&mdash;the
heir’s own name for himself, which Blanche made a point
of using in conversation with Aunt Charlotte because
that lady considered it vulgar&mdash;had been seen at the
Savoy with a girl, he had been seen in the Park with a
girl, he had been seen motoring with a girl; in fact, he
had been going about with a girl for several weeks.</p>

<p>“And you never told <i>me</i>,” said Lady Wargrave with
the air of a tragedy queen. She looked from Blanche
to Sarah, from Sarah to Marjorie. A light of sour
sarcasm in the eye of the eldest flower was all the comfort
she took from the survey.</p>

<p>“Who is the girl? Tell me.”</p>

<p>Blanche inclined to think an actress. But she was not
sure.</p>

<p>“Inquiries will have to be made at once.” Already
Aunt Charlotte was a caldron of energy. “Steps will
have to be taken. It is the first I have heard of it. But
I feel I ought to have been told sooner.”</p>

<p>Blanche fearlessly asked why.</p>

<p>“Why!” Aunt Charlotte gave a little snort. At such
a moment mere words were futile. Then she said,
“I shall go at once to your father.”</p>

<p>“But what can <i>he</i> do?”</p>

<p>“Do?” Aunt Charlotte gave a second little snort.
Mere words again revealed their limitations.</p>

<p>“Yes?” Blanche placidly pursued the Socratic
method, to the increasing fury of Aunt Charlotte.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“He can tell him what he thinks of him and threaten
to cut off supplies.”</p>

<p>“Much he’ll care for that!” The cynicism of Blanche
revolted Aunt Charlotte.</p>

<p>That lady, whose forte, after all, was plain common sense,
knew that Blanche was right. But in spite of
that knowledge, the resolute energy which made her so
much disliked impelled her to go at once to lay the
matter before the head of the house.</p>

<p>Lady Wargrave found her brother in the smaller
library, long dedicated by custom to his sole use. It was
one of the less pretentious and therefore least uncomfortable
rooms in a house altogether too large to be
decently habitable.</p>

<p>For many years the Duke had been at the mercy of a
painful malady which had taken all the pleasure out of
his life. He was nearly seventy now, a man strikingly
handsome in spite of a sufferer’s mouth and eyes weary
with pain and cynicism. When his sister entered the
room she found him deployed on an invalid chair, the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> on a book-rest in front of him, and a
wineglass containing medicine at his elbow. And to
Lady Wargrave’s clear annoyance, a tall, gray-haired,
rather austere-looking, but decidedly handsome woman,
stood by the Adam chimney-piece, a bottle in one hand,
a teaspoon in the other.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will be kind enough to leave us, Mrs.
Sanderson,” said Lady Wargrave, in a tone which
sounded needlessly elaborate.</p>

<p>Harriet Sanderson, without so much as a temporary
relaxation of muscle of her strong face, withdrew at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
once very silently from the room. The bottle and the
teaspoon went with her.</p>

<p>As soon as the door had closed Lady Wargrave said,
“Johnnie, once more I feel bound to protest against the
presence of the housekeeper in the library. If the state
of your health really calls for such attention I will
engage a trained nurse.”</p>

<p>The Duke took up the <i>Quarterly Review</i> with an air
of stolid indifference.</p>

<p>“I’ll get one at once,” she persisted. “There’s a
capable person who nursed Mary Devizes.”</p>

<p>The Duke seemed unwilling to discuss the question,
but at last, yielding to pressure, he said in a tone of dry
exasperation:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Sanderson is quite capable of looking after me.
She understands my ways, I understand hers.”</p>

<p>“No one doubts her competence.” The rejoinder was
tart and hostile. “But that is hardly the point. The
library is not the place for the housekeeper.”</p>

<p>“I choose to have her here. In any case it is entirely
my affair.”</p>

<p>“People talk.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em.”</p>

<p>“It’s an old quarrel, my friend.” Growing asperity
was in the voice of Charlotte. “You know my views
on the subject of Mrs. Sanderson. We none of us like
the woman. Considering the position she holds she has
always taken far too much upon herself.”</p>

<p>The Duke shook his head. “I must be the judge of
that,” he said.</p>

<p>“But surely it is a matter for the women of your
family.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“With all submission, it’s a matter for me. I find the
present arrangement entirely satisfactory, and I don’t
recognize the right of anyone to interfere.”</p>

<p>The Duke’s tone grated like a file upon his sister’s
ear. This was an ancient quarrel that in one form or
another had been going on for very many years. The
housekeeper at Buntisford and more recently at Bridport
House had been a thorn in the flesh of Charlotte almost
from the day her sister-in-law died, but the Duke had
always been Mrs. Sanderson’s champion. Time and
again her overthrow had been decided upon by the ladies
of the Family, but up till now the perverse determination
of his Grace had proved too much for them and all
their careful schemes.</p>

<p>They had reached the usual impasse. Therefore, for
the time being, Charlotte had once more to swallow her
feelings. Besides, other matters were in the air, matters
of an interest more vital if of a nature less permanent.</p>

<p>As a preliminary it was necessary to glance at Muriel
and her vagaries, before coming to grips with the even
more momentous affair which had just been brought to
Lady Wargrave’s notice. In answer to his sister’s,
“What have you said to Maclean?” the Duke, who
had swallowed most of the formulas and had digested
them pretty thoroughly, expressed himself characteristically.</p>

<p>“I told him that before I could even begin to consider
the question he would have to rat.”</p>

<p>“Was that wise?” said Charlotte, frowning. “Why
commit oneself to the possibility of having to take the
man seriously?”</p>

<p>Her brother laughed. “He’s a very sharp fellow. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
long Scotch head, abominably full of brains. If we could
get him on our side perhaps he might pull us together.”</p>

<p>“You know, of course, that his mother kept the village
shop at Ardnaleuchan?”</p>

<p>“So he tells me.”</p>

<p>“Do you like the prospect of such a son-in-law?”</p>

<p>“Frankly, Charlotte, I don’t. A tiresome business at
the best of it. But there it is.”</p>

<p>“Ought one to treat it so coolly?”</p>

<p>His Grace laid the <i>Quarterly Review</i> on the book-rest
and plucked a little peevishly at the tuft of hair on
his chin.</p>

<p>“The times are changing, you see. We are on the
eve of strange things. Still, I took the liberty of telling
him that as long as he remained a Radical and went up
and down the country blackguarding me and mine, I
should refuse to know him.”</p>

<p>“And what said our fine gentleman?”</p>

<p>“He was amused. Whether he takes the hint remains
to be seen. In any event it commits us to nothing.”</p>

<p>Charlotte shook a dubious head. “You’re shaping for
a compromise, my friend. And in my view this is not
a case for one.”</p>

<p>“If she is set on marrying the brute what’s going to
stop her?”</p>

<p>The question was meant for a poser and a poser it
proved. Somehow it left no ground for argument.
Therefore, without further preface or apology, Lady
Wargrave turned to a matter of even more vital consequence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p class="ph2">IV</p>

<p>By an odd chain of events, Jack Dinneford was heir
apparent to the dukedom of Bridport. In the course
of a brief twelve months two intervening lives had
petered out. One had been Lyme, the Duke’s only
surviving son, who at the age of thirty-five had been
killed in a shooting accident&mdash;a younger son, never a
good life, had died some years earlier&mdash;the other had
been the Duke’s younger brother, who six months ago
had died without male issue. The succession in consequence
would now have to pass to an obscure and rather
neglected branch of the family, represented by a young
man of twenty-four, the son of a Norfolk parson.</p>

<p>Jack’s father, at the time of his death, had held a
family living. A retiring, scholarly man, he had never
courted the favors of the great, and the great, little
suspecting that their vicarious splendors might one day
be his, had paid him little attention. Blessed with
progeny of the usual clerical abundance and without
means apart from his stipend, the incumbent of Wickley-on-the-Wold
had been hard set to educate his children
in a manner becoming their august lineage. Even Jack,
the eldest of five, had to be content with four years at
one of the smaller public schools. It was true that
afterwards he had the option of Oxford or Sandhurst,
but by the time the young man had reached the age of
nineteen he had somehow acquired an independence of
character which did not take kindly to either.</p>

<p>One fine day, with a spare suit of clothes and a
hundred pounds or so in his pocket, he set out in the
most casual way to see the world, and to make his fortune.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
He went to Liverpool, shipped before the mast
as an ordinary seaman for the sake of the experience,
and made the voyage round the Horn to San Francisco.
For the next two years he prospected up and down the
Americas earning a living, picking up ideas, and enlarging
his outlook by association with all sorts and conditions
of men, and finally invested all the capital he could
scrape together in a business in Vancouver.</p>

<p>After eighteen months of the new life came the news
of his father’s death. The brothers and sisters it seemed
were rather better provided for than there had been
reason to expect. At any rate, Mabel and Iris would
have a roof over their heads, Bill had passed into Sandhurst,
and Frank was at Cambridge. Therefore Jack,
little guessing what Fate had in store, decided to stay
as he was, in the hope that in a few years he would have
made his pile. He had a taste for hard work, and the
new land offered opportunities denied by the old.</p>

<p>Some months later he received an urgent summons
to return home. He had suddenly and unexpectedly
become next of kin to the Duke of Bridport. The news
was little to the young man’s taste. He was very loth to
give up a growing business for a life of parasitic idleness
under the ægis of the titular great. But the circumstances
seemed to make it imperative. The powers that
were had not the slightest doubt that it was his bounden
duty to go into training at once. He must fit himself
for the dizzy eminence to which it had pleased Providence
to call him.</p>

<p>Sadly enough the tiro sold out, returned to England,
and in due course reported himself at Bridport House.
It was the first time he had been there. He was such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
a distant kinsman that he had never taken the ducal
connection seriously.</p>

<p>The family’s reception of the Tenderfoot&mdash;his own
humorous name for himself&mdash;amused him considerably,
yet at the same time it filled him with a subtle annoyance.
Five fruitful years out West had made him an iconoclast.
He saw with awakened eyes the arid and sterile pomposities
which were doing their best to put the old land
out of the race. Bridport House was going to spell
boredom and worse for Jack Dinneford.</p>

<p>Still the Duke, as became a man of the world, soon got
to the root of the trouble, and having the welfare of
a time-honored institution at heart, was at pains to deal
with the novice tactfully. All the same, he was far
from being pleased by the tricks of Providence. But
he made the young man an allowance of two thousand a
year, and exhorted him not to get into mischief; and the
Dinneford ladies, who were prepared to be kind to the
Tenderfoot and to be more amused by his “originality”
than they confessed to each other, chose some rooms for
him in Arlington Street, looked after his general welfare,
and began to make plans for the future of Bridport
House. Aunt Charlotte took him at once under an ungracious
wing, and found him a bear-leader in the person
of her nephew Wrexham, a subaltern of the Pinks, a
picturesque young man, reputed a paragon of all the
Christian virtues, and a martyr to a sense of duty.</p>

<p>From this model of discretion the tiro soon received a
hint. Cousin Sarah owned to thirty-eight in the glare
of Debrett, Cousin Muriel had other views apparently,
but there remained Cousin Blanche and Cousin Marjorie&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
heir could take his choice, but the ukase had gone
forth that one of them it must be.</p>

<p>The Tenderfoot did not feel in a marrying mood just
then, but he had chivalry enough not to say so to his
mentor, who as the messenger of Eros began to disclose
quite a pretty turn of humor. It was not seemly to offer
advice in such a delicate matter, but Blanche was a
nailer to hounds, although she never kept awake after
dinner, while Marjorie’s sphere was church decoration in
times of festival, in the course of which she generally
had an <i>affaire</i> with a curate.</p>

<p>Face to face with a problem which in one way or
another was kept ever before his eyes, the poor Tenderfoot
seemed to feel that if wive he must in the charmèd
circle, and the relentless Wrexham assured him that it
was a solemn duty, perhaps there was most to be said
for Cousin Marjorie. She was not supremely attractive
it was true. The Dinneford girls, one and all, were
famous up and down the island for a resolute absence of
charm. And the Dinneford frontispiece, imposing
enough in the male, when rendered in terms of the female
somehow seemed to lack poetry. Still Cousin Marjorie
was not yet thirty and her general health was excellent.</p>

<p>The heir had now been settled in Arlington Street six
months. And with nothing in the world to do but learn
to live a life which threatened to bore him exceedingly,
time began to hang upon his hands. Moreover, the
prospect of having presently to lead Cousin Marjorie to
the altar merely increased a sense of malaise. Here
was an arbitrary deepening of the tones of a picture
which heaven knew was dark enough already. For a
modern and virile young man, life at Bridport House<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
would only be tolerable under very happy conditions.
To be yoked, willy-nilly, to one of its native denizens
for the rest of one’s days, seemed a hardship almost
too great to be borne.</p>

<p>While the Tenderfoot was in this frame of mind,
which inclined him to temporize, he decided to put off
the dark hour as long as he could. And then suddenly,
while still besieged by doubt, the hypnotic Princess
Bedalia swam into his ken.</p>

<p class="ph2">V</p>

<p>“It was bound to happen,” said Lady Wargrave.
“That young man has far too much time on his hands.
A thousand pities he didn’t go into the army.”</p>

<p>“Too old, too old.” Her brother frowned portentously.
“This promises to be a very tiresome business.
Charlotte, I must really ask you to lose no time in
seeing that the fellow marries.”</p>

<p>It was now Charlotte’s turn to frown. And this she
did as a prelude to a frankness which verged upon the
brutal.</p>

<p>“All very well, my friend, but perhaps you’ll tell me
how it’s to be done. Neither Marjorie nor Blanche has
the least power of attraction. They’re hopeless. And
please remember this young man has been five years in
America.”</p>

<p>“I would to God he had stayed there!”</p>

<p>The futile outburst of his Grace set Charlotte glowering
like a sibyl. She was constrained to own that it was
all intensely annoying. He was a common young man.
He had none of the Dinneford feeling about things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“Quite so, Charlotte.” The ducal irritation was growing
steadily. “But don’t rub it in. That won’t help
us. Let us think constructively. You see the trouble
is that this fellow has a rather democratic outlook.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m afraid there’s no remedy,” said Charlotte,
“unless the girls have the brains to help us, which, of
course, they haven’t.”</p>

<p>His Grace became more thunderous. “Let us hope
he’ll have the good feeling to try to look at things as we
do,” he said after a rather arid pause.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that we’ve a right to expect it,” was the
frank rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“His branch of the family has no particular cause to
be grateful to us.”</p>

<p>“Our father gave his father a living, didn’t he?” said
the Duke sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes, but nothing else&mdash;unless it was a day’s shooting
now and again, which he didn’t accept.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what else he could have given him.”</p>

<p>“An eye ought to have been kept on this young man.”</p>

<p>“You can depend upon it, Charlotte, many things
would have been ordered differently had there been
reason to suppose that this confounded fellow would be
next in here. As it is we have to make the best of a
sorry business.”</p>

<p>“Sorry enough,” Charlotte admitted. “There I am
with you. But I’ll have inquiries made about this chorus
girl. And in the meantime, Johnnie, perhaps you will
speak to him firmly and quietly without losing your
temper.”</p>

<p>“And my last word to you, Charlotte,” countered his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
Grace, “is to see that he loses no time in marrying.”</p>

<p>“Easy, my friend, to issue a ukase.” And the redoubtable
Charlotte smiled grimly.</p>

<p class="ph2">VI</p>

<p>Soon after four the same afternoon Jack returned
to Broad Place in the garb of civilization. He was in
great heart. Milly had some good-natured chaff to offer
as to Mary’s need of sticking plaster. But the young
man turned this persiflage aside with such a serious air
that the quick-witted Milly knew it for an omen. Having
learned the set of the wind she soon found a pretext for
leaving them together.</p>

<p>Milly’s sense of a coming event, which her sudden
flight from the room had seemed to make the more
inevitable, was shared by Mary. Somehow she felt that
the moment of moments had come. This thing had
to be. But as a hand brown and virile quietly took hers
in a strong grip, she began almost bitterly to deplore the
whole business. And yet, when all was said, she was
absolutely thrilled. He was so truly a man that a girl,
no matter what her talent and quality, could hardly
refrain from pride in his homage.</p>

<p>There was no beating about the bush.</p>

<p>“Will you marry me?” he said.</p>

<p>She grew crimson. How she had dreaded that long
foreseen question! Days ago common sense and worldly
prudence had coldly informed her that there could only
be one possible answer. The case of Milly herself had
furnished a sinister parallel. And the sensitive, perhaps
over-sensitive pride of one who had begun at the bottom
of the ladder, revolted from all the ensuing complications.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Such a situation seemed now to involve her in
mysteries far down within, at the very core of being&mdash;mysteries
she had hardly been aware of until that
moment.</p>

<p>Again the question. She looked away, quite unable
just then to meet his eyes. Her will was strong, her
determination clear, but in spite of herself a deadly feeling
crept upon her that she was a bird in a snare.
Certain imponderables were in the room. The life
forces were calling to each other; there was a curious
magnetism in the very air they breathed.</p>

<p>She had meant and intended “No,” but every instant
made that little word more difficult to utter. A dominant
nature had stolen the keys of her heart before she knew
it. And as she fought against the inevitable, a subtle
trick of the ape on the chain in the human breast,
weighed the scales unfairly. Cousin Blanche and Cousin
Marjorie were flung oddly, irrelevantly, fantastically,
upon the curtain of her mind. The challenge of their
ironical eyes was like a knife in the flesh. And then
that private, particular devil, of whose existence, until
that moment, she had been unaware, suddenly forced her
to take up the gage those eyes had flung.</p>

<p class="ph2">VII</p>

<p>“Do tell me!” cried Milly the breathless.</p>

<p>The sight of a lone, troubled Mary in the little sitting-room,
the look on her face as she twisted a handkerchief
into knots and coils had been too much for Milly. She
was a downright person and the silence of Mary was
so trying to a forthcoming nature that the query at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
tip of Milly’s tongue seemed likely to burn a hole in it.</p>

<p>“Has he&mdash;have you&mdash;did he&mdash;&mdash;?” The demand was
indelicate, but it sprang from the depths as Milly
measured them. Suddenly she saw tears.</p>

<p>“I am so glad, I am so <i>very</i> glad!”</p>

<p>Mary smiled, but the look in her eyes had the power
to startle the affectionate Milly.</p>

<p>“He is the luckiest man I know, but he is such a dear
that he deserves to be.” It was a peculiarity of Mary’s
that she didn’t like kissing, but Milly in a burst of loyal
affection was guilty of a sudden swoop upon her friend.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t,” said Mary, in a voice from which all the
accustomed gayety was gone.</p>

<p>Milly gazed in consternation.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you have not refused him?”</p>

<p>“No.” And then there came a sudden flame. “I’m
a selfish, egotistical wretch.”</p>

<p>“As long as you have not refused him,” said Milly,
breathing again. “All the same, I call you a very odd
girl.”</p>

<p>But Mary was troubled, Milly perplexed.</p>

<p>“You ought to be the happiest creature alive. What’s
the matter?”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of his friends.”</p>

<p>“If they choose to be stupid, it’s their own lookout.”</p>

<p>“It mayn’t be stupidity,” said Mary, giving her handkerchief
a bite. “I know nothing about him, except&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Except?”</p>

<p>“That he’s above me socially.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry about that if I were you,” said
Milly robustly. “If they like to be snobs it’s their own
funeral.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>But Mary, having burned her boats, was afflicted now
by Cousin Blanche and Cousin Marjorie. They were
looking down upon her from their tall horses. It was
not that she feared them in the least, but she knew that
lurking somewhere in an oddly constituted mind was a
certain awe of the things for which they stood.</p>

<p>“I can’t explain my feelings,” said Mary. “I only
know they are horribly real. I feel there’s a gulf between
Jack and me&mdash;and a word won’t bridge it.” And
her voice trailed off miserably.</p>

<p>“That’s weak,” said Milly severely. “I know what
you mean, but you exaggerate the difference absurdly.
Sonny is miles above me socially, but I’ll make him as
good a wife as any of his own push, see if I don’t&mdash;if
he gives me the chance! And in some ways I can make
him a better.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Because I began right down there.” Milly pointed
to the carpet. “I know the value of things, I shall be
able to see that no one takes advantage of him, whereas
a girl who has been spoon-fed all her life couldn’t do
that.”</p>

<p>The honest Mary had to allow that there was something
to be said for the point of view, yet she would not admit
that it covered all the facts of the case.</p>

<p>“Please don’t suppose my ideas have anything to do
with you and Lord Wrexham.” Her gravity made Milly
feel quite annoyed. “I am merely thinking of myself.
And there’s something in me, for which I can’t account,
which says that it may be wrong, it may be wickedly
wrong, for me to marry Jack.”</p>

<p>“It certainly will be if that’s how you look at it,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
Milly scornfully. “Why not make the most of your
luck? I’m sure it’s right. After all Providence knows
better than anybody. And Jack knows he’s got to be
a duke.”</p>

<p>“Got to be what?” Mary jumped out of her chair.</p>

<p>“You didn’t know?”</p>

<p>“Of course, I didn’t.” She was simply aghast. In a
state of excitement which quite baffled Milly, she paced
the room.</p>

<p>“You <i>odd</i> creature!” The mantle of the arch dissembler
had now descended upon Milly.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, she and her mother had had a shrewd
suspicion of Mary’s ignorance. They had learned from
Wrexham that Jack Dinneford, owing to a series of
deaths in a great family, had quite unexpectedly become
the next-of-kin to the Duke of Bridport. Such a
prospect was so little to the young man’s taste that as
far as he could he always made a point of keeping the
skeleton out of sight. Rightly or wrongly he had not
said a word to Mary on the subject, and she with a
pride a little overstrained, no doubt, had allowed herself
no curiosity in regard to his worldly status. For whatever
it might be it was obviously far removed from that
of a girl of no family who had to get her own living as
well as she could.</p>

<p>The news was stunning. As Mary walked about the
room the look on her face was almost tragic.</p>

<p>“I think you ought to have told me,” she said at last.</p>

<p>“We thought you knew,” was Milly’s reply. This
was a deliberate story. Mrs. Wren and herself in discussing
the romantic news had concluded the exact opposite.
But out of a true regard for Mary’s welfare, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
they conceived it, they had decided to let her find out for
herself. She was such an odd girl in certain ways that
mother and daughter felt that the real truth about Jack
Dinneford might easily prove his overthrow. Thus with
a chaste conscience Milly now lied royally.</p>

<p>Mary, alas! was so resentful of the <i>coup</i> of fortune
and her friends, that for a moment she was tempted to
fix a quarrel on Milly. But Milly’s cunning was too
much for her. She stuck to the simple statement that
she thought she knew. There was no gainsaying it.
And if blame there was in the matter it surely lay at
the door of her own proud self.</p>

<p>Mary was still in the throes of an unwelcome discovery
when Mrs. Wren came into the room. The
appearance of that lady seemed to add fuel to the flame.
Her felicitations, a little overwhelming in their exuberance,
were in nowise damped by the girl’s dejection. To
Mrs. Wren such an attitude of mind was not merely
unreasonable, it was unchristian. To call in question
the highest gifts of Providence betrayed a kink in a
charming character.</p>

<p>“Fancy, my dear&mdash;a duchess. You’ll be next in rank
to royalty.”</p>

<p>It was so hard for the victim to smother the tempest
within that for the moment she dare not trust herself
to speak.</p>

<p>“You’re very naughty,” said Mrs. Wren. “Why, you
ought to offer up a prayer. You’ve had success too
easily, the road has been too smooth. If you’d had a
smaller talent and you’d had an awful struggle to get
there, you’d know better than to crab your luck.”</p>

<p>A strong will now came to Mary’s aid. And the calm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
force of her answer, when at last she was able to make
it, astonished Milly and her mother. “That’s one side
of the case, Mrs. Wren,” she said in a new tone. “But
there’s another, you know.”</p>

<p>“There is only one side for you, my dear,” said the
older woman stoutly. “Take your chances while you
may&mdash;that’s my advice. Your luck may turn. You’ll
not always be what you are now. Suppose you have
a bad illness?”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of his side of the case.” The tone
verged upon sternness.</p>

<p>“You have quite enough to do to think of your own.
Don’t throw chances away. I have had forty years’
experience of a very hard profession, and even you top
sawyers are on very thin ice. And remember, the cards
never forgive. Girls who have a lone hand to play, mustn’t
hold their heads too high. If they do they’ll live to
regret it. And you mustn’t think these swells can’t box
their own corner. They’ve nothing to learn in looking
after Number One. A girl of your sort is quite equal
to any of these drawing-room noodles and Mr. Dinneford
knows that better than I do.”</p>

<p>“But that’s impossible. I can never be as they are.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t let that worry you. A lot of stuck-up
dunces that all the world kow-tows to!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that I think they are nicer or cleverer or
wiser than other people. But they are born to certain
things, they have been bred to them for generations, and
it surely stands to reason that they are better at their own
game than a mere outsider can hope to be.”</p>

<p>“Fiddle-de-dee!” said Mrs. Wren. “I hope you are
not such a goose as to take swelldom at its own valuation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
It’s all a bluff, my dear. Your humble servant,
Jane Wren, could have been as good a duchess as the
best of ’em if she had been given the chance. I don’t
want to be fulsome, my dear, but I’ll back a girl of your
brains against Lady Agatha Fitzboodle or any other
titled snob.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to be pitted against anybody!”</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense.” Mrs. Wren shook a worldly-wise
head. “As for being an outsider, a girl can’t be more
than a lady just as a man can’t be more than a gentleman.
And if you are a lady and have always gone straight
you needn’t fear comparison with the highest in the
land.”</p>

<p>Mary shook a head of sadness and perplexity.</p>

<p>“Somehow it doesn’t seem right to mix things in that
way,” she said.</p>

<p>“It’s the only way that keeps ’em going,” said Mrs.
Wren scornfully. “And well they know it. At least
nature knows it. Look at Wrexham! Do you mean
to say that his inbred strain wouldn’t be improved by
Milly? And it’s the same with you and Mr. Dinneford.
It’s Nature at the back of it all. It’s the call of the
blood. If these old families keep on intermarrying long
enough dry rot sets in.”</p>

<p>Mary stood a picture of woe.</p>

<p>“You odd creature!” said Mrs. Wren. “I’ve never
met a girl with such ideas as yours. I really believe
you are quite as narrow and as prejudiced as Lady
Agatha Fitzboodle. To hear you talk one would think
you believed rank to be a really important matter.”</p>

<p>Incredulous eyes were opened upon the voluble dame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>“Of course it is.” But the girl’s solemnity was a
little too much.</p>

<p>“My dear!” A gust of ribald laughter overwhelmed
her. “Hasn’t it ever struck you that the so-called aristocracy
racket is all a bluff?”</p>

<p>“Surely, it can’t be.” The tone was genuine dismay.</p>

<p>“Every word of it, my dear. There’s only one thing
behind it and that’s money. If Wrexham ever sticks a
coronet on the head of my Milly and robes her in ermine
she’ll be the equal of any in the land, just as old Bill
Brown who was in the last birthday honors is as good a
peer as the best of ’em now that his soap business has
brought him into Park Lane. I knew Bill when he
hadn’t a bob. It’s just a matter of L.S.D. As for the
frills, they are all my eye and Elizabeth Martin. When
my Milly gets among them, it won’t take her a week to
learn all their tricks. They are just so many performing
dogs.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand, you don’t understand!” The
tone was tragic.</p>

<p class="ph2">VIII</p>

<p>A night’s reflection convinced the girl that there was
only one thing to be done. The engagement must end.
But as she soon found, it was easier to make the resolve
than to carry it out. To begin with, it was terribly irksome,
in present circumstances, to give effect to her
decision and to back it with reasons.</p>

<p>Her début in the Row had been so successful that a
ride had been arranged for the next morning. But it
was spoiled completely by the specter now haunting her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
In what terms could she tell him that she had changed
her mind? How could she defend a proceeding so
unwarrantable?</p>

<p>It was not until later in the day, when they took a
stroll under the trees in the Park, that she forced herself
to grasp the nettle boldly.</p>

<p>Jack, as she had foreseen, was immeasurably astonished.
He called, at once, for her reasons. And they
were terribly difficult to put into words. At last she was
driven back upon the cardinal fact that he had concealed
his true position.</p>

<p>He repudiated the charge indignantly. In the first
place, he had taken it for granted that she knew his position,
in the second, he always made a point of leaving it
as much as possible outside his calculations.</p>

<p>“But isn’t that just what one oughtn’t to do?” she
said, as they took possession of a couple of vacant chairs.</p>

<p>“To me the whole thing’s absurd,” was the rejoinder.
“It’s only by the merest fluke that I have to succeed to
the title, and I find it quite impossible to feel about things
as Bridport House does. The whole business is a great
bore, and if a way out could be found I’d much rather
stay as I am.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t that just a wee bit selfish, my dear&mdash;if you
don’t think me a prig?”</p>

<p>“If you are quite out of sympathy with an antediluvian
system, if you disbelieve in it, if you hate it in the
marrow of your bones, where’s the virtue in sacrificing
yourself in order to maintain it?”</p>

<p>“Noblesse oblige!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but does it? A dukedom, in my view, is just an
outworn convention, a survival of a darker age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“It stands for something.”</p>

<p>“What does it stand for?&mdash;that’s the point. There’s
no damned merit about it, you know. Any fool can be
a duke, and they mostly are.”</p>

<p>Mary, if a little amused, was more than a little
shocked.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it’s not right to think that,” she declared
stoutly. “I would say myself, although one oughtn’t to
have a say on the subject, that it’s the duty of your sort
of people to keep things going.”</p>

<p>“They are not my sort of people. I was pitchforked
among them. And if you don’t believe in them and the
things it is their duty to keep going what becomes of
your theory, Miss Scrupulous?”</p>

<p>“But that’s Socialism,” said Mary with solemn eyes.</p>

<p>“No, it’s the common sense of the matter. All this
centralization of power in the hands of a few hard-shells
like my Uncle Albert&mdash;he’s not my uncle really&mdash;is very
bad for the State. He owns one-fifth of Scotland, and
the only things he ever really takes seriously are his
meals and his health.”</p>

<p>“He stands for something all the same.”</p>

<p>The young man laughed outright.</p>

<p>“I know I’m a prig.” The blushing candor disarmed
him. “But if one has a great bump of reverence I suppose
one can’t help exaggerating one’s feelings a little.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” laughed the young man. And then
there was a pause. “By jove,” he said at the end of
it, “you’d be the last word in duchesses.”</p>

<p>“You won’t get Bridport House to think so.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse for Bridport House. Of course,
I admit it has other views for me. But the trouble is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
as always in these close corporations, they haven’t the
art of seeing things as they are.”</p>

<p>Mary shook a troubled head, but the argument seemed
to find its way home.</p>

<p>“The truth of the matter is,” he suddenly declared,
“you are afraid of Bridport House.”</p>

<p>Without shame she confessed that Bridport House
was bound to be very hostile, and was there not every
reason for such an attitude? Jack, however, would not
yield an inch upon that count, or on any other if it came
to that. He was a primitive creature in whom the call
of the blood was paramount. Moreover, he was a very
tenacious fellow. And these arguments of hers, strongly
urged and boldly stated, did not affect his point of view.
The ban of Fortune was purely artificial, it could not be
defended. She was fain, therefore, to carry the war to
the enemy’s country. But if she gently hinted a change
of egotism he countered it astutely with the subtler one
of sentimentalism. Each confessed the other partially
right, but so far from clearing the air it seemed to make
the whole matter more complex. The upshot was that
he called upon her to find a valid reason, otherwise he
refused point-blank to give her up.</p>

<p>“Just think,” he said, tracing her name on the gravel
with a walking-stick, “how hollow the whole business is.
How many of Uncle Albert’s ‘push’ have married American
wives without a question? And why do they, when
they wouldn’t think of giving English girls of the same
class an equal chance? In the first place, for the sake
of the dollars, in the second, because it is so easy for
them to shed their relations and forget their origin.”</p>

<p>But so wide was the gulf between their points of view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
that mere argument could not hope to bridge it. If she
was in grim earnest, so was he; moreover she had
entered into a compact he was determined she should
fulfill. Before consenting to release her she would have
to show very good cause at any rate.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the give-and-take of conflict, Laxton
came into her mind. The memory of Beaconsfield
Villas, the whimsical creatures of another orbit, and the
childhood which now seemed ages away, fired her with
a new idea. She would take him to see the humble
people among whom she had been brought up.</p>

<p class="ph2">I</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> flight of time had affected Beaconsfield Villas
surprisingly little. Laxton itself had deferred to
Anno Domini in many subtle ways; it had its
electric trams and motor-buses, and the suburb had
doubled in size, but no epoch-making changes were visible
in the front sitting-room of Number Five. In that
homely interior the cosmic march and profluence was
simply revealed by a gramophone, the gift of Mary, on
the top of the sewing machine in the corner, and by the
accession to the walls of lithograph portraits of the son
and grandson of the august lady who still held pride of
place over the chimney-piece.</p>

<p>The afternoon was stifling even for South London in
the middle of June. And Joseph Kelly, who had attained
the rank of sergeant in the Metropolitan Police
Force, not having to go on duty until six o’clock that
evening, was seated coatless and solemn, spectacles on
nose, smoking a well-colored clay and reading the <i>Daily
Mail</i>. At the level of his eyes, in portentous type was,
“Laxton Bye-Election. A Sharp Contest. New Home
Secretary’s Chances.” Joe was a shade stouter than of
yore, his face was even redder, a thinning thatch had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
turned gray, but in all essentials the man himself was
still the genial cockney of one-and-twenty years ago.</p>

<p>The outer door of the sitting-room, which was next
the street, was wide open to invite the air. But ever
and again there rose such a fierce medley of noises from
a mysterious cause a little distance off, that at last Joe
got up from his chair, and waddling across the room in
a pair of worn list slippers, banged the door against
the sounds from the street which had the power to annoy
him considerably.</p>

<p>Hardly had Joe shuffled back to his chair and his
newspaper when the door was flung open again and an
excited urchin thrust a tousled head into the room.</p>

<p>“‘Vote for Maclean an’ a free breakfast-table’!”</p>

<p>The law in the person of Sergeant Kelly rose from
its chair majestically.</p>

<p>“If you ain’t off&mdash;my word!”</p>

<p>Headlong flight of the urchin. Joe closed the door
with violence and sat down again. But the incident had
unsettled him. He seemed unable to fix his mind on
the newspaper. And the noises in the street waxed ever
louder. Now they took the form of cheers and counter
cheers, now of hoots, cat-calls and shouts of derision. At
last the tumult rose to such a pitch that it drew Eliza
from an inner room.</p>

<p>The years had changed her rather more than her husband.
But she was still the active, capable, bustling
housewife, with a keen eye for the world and all that
was passing in it.</p>

<p>“They are making noise enough to wake the dead.”
Eliza looked eagerly through the window.</p>

<p>“I wish that durned Scotchman hadn’t set his committee-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
plumb oppersite Number Five, Beaconsfield
Villas,” was Joe’s sour comment.</p>

<p>At that moment the all-embracing eye of a relentless
housewife swooped down upon a card lying innocently
on the linoleum. It had been flung there by the recent
visitor. Eliza picked it up and read:</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="left no-indent">Vote for Maclean, thus:<br />
<span class="left2"><span class="smcap">Maclean</span></span>&ensp;&ensp;X<br />
<span class="left2"><span class="smcap">Whitley</span>.</span></p></div>

<p>On the back of the card was a portrait of Sir Dugald
Maclean, M.P.</p>

<p>Eliza gazed at it in astonishment mingled with awe.</p>

<p>“I am bound to say he is a better-favored jockey than
when he came a-courting our Harriet. Look, Joe!”</p>

<p>With scornful vehemence, Joe declined the invitation.</p>

<p>Eliza was sternly advised to tear up the card, but
instead she chose to set it on the chimney-piece. The
rash act was too much for her lord. Once more he rose
from his chair, tore the card into little pieces and flung
them into a grate artistically decorated with colored
paper.</p>

<p>“You are jealous!” said Eliza, laughing.</p>

<p>“Of the likes of him! Holy smoke! But if you think
we are going to have such trash in the same room as the
Marquis, you make an error.”</p>

<p>The words had hardly been uttered when shouts yet
more piercing came from the street. Eliza made a hasty
return to the window.</p>

<p>“Come and look, Joe!” she cried breathlessly. “Here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
he is with his top hat and eyeglass. He’s that dossy
you wouldn’t know him. He’s dressed up like a tailor’s
dummy.”</p>

<p>But Joe declined to budge.</p>

<p>“It fairly makes me sick to think of the feller,” he
said.</p>

<p>A little later, when the tumult in the street had died
down a bit, Joe settled himself in his chair for an afternoon
nap. Eliza, duly noting the symptoms, retired on
tiptoe to another room, closing the door after her gently.
But today, alas, the skyey influences were adverse. Joe
had barely entered oblivion when a smart tap at the street
door shattered this precarious peace. With a grudge
against society he rose once more, shambled across the
room and flung open the door, half expecting to find that
the urchin had returned to torment him. A dramatic
surprise was in store. On the threshold was a creature
so stylishly trim that even the blasé eye of the Metropolitan
Force was sensibly thrilled in beholding her. “A
bit of class” without a doubt, although adorned by the
colors of the People’s Candidate, and surprisingly cool
in sheer defiance of the thermometer.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon!” The tone of half-confidential intimacy
was quite irresistible. “May I have a little talk
with you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, miss.” The unconscious gallantry of an
impressionable policeman was more than equal to the
occasion. “Step inside and make yourself at home.”</p>

<p>When Joe came to review the incident afterwards, it
seemed very surprising that he should have yielded so
easily to the impact of this elegant miss. For instinctively
he knew her business. Moreover, the last thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
he desired at that moment was to be troubled by her or
by it. But he had been taken by surprise, and in all
circumstances he would have needed ample notice to
deny a lady. He had a great but impersonal regard for
a lady, as some people have for a Rembrandt or a Corot
or a Jan van Steen. And although the fact was not
important, perhaps his sense of humor was a little
touched by such a young woman taking the trouble to
come and talk to such a man as himself.</p>

<p>“I am here,” said the voice of the dove, as soon as its
owner had subsided gracefully upon a chair covered with
horsehair, “to ask your vote and interest for Sir Dugald
Maclean, the People’s Candidate.”</p>

<p>The prophetic soul of Joe had told him that already.
But again the sense of humor, the fatal gift, may have
intervened. Had the elegant miss had any <i>nous</i>, she
would have known that a sergeant of the X Division has
not a vote to bestow. In justice to the fair democrat,
Joe might have reflected that in the absence of his tunic
there was nothing to show his status. However, he
didn’t trouble to do that. It was enough for him that
she was on a fool’s errand. But Joe was a man of the
world as well as a connoisseur of the human female. A
picturesque personality intrigued him. Moreover, it was
working for a cause that Joe despised from the depths
of his soul. So much was she “the real thing” that she
had even turned on a melodious lisp for his benefit; yet
he had no particular wish, even under these flattering
auspices, to discuss the people and their champion. He
had quite made up his mind about both. But, the
Machiavellian thought occurred to him, here was a
dangerous implement in the hands of the foe, therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
it would be the part of wisdom to waste a little of her
time.</p>

<p>“‘Government of the people, by the people, for the
people,’” lisped the siren, “that, of course, as you may
know, is what Sir Dugald stands for.”</p>

<p>“Does he!” reflected Joe. With a roguish smile he
looked the speaker over from her expensive top to her
equally expensive toe.</p>

<p>“You <i>do</i> believe in the people?” said the siren with a
rather dubious air.</p>

<p>“Since you ask the question, miss,” said Joe, “I am
bound to say I don’t, and never have done.”</p>

<p>“Not believe in the <i>people!</i>” It didn’t seem possible.</p>

<p>“If you’d seen as much of the people as I have, miss,”
said Joe grimly, “I’m thinking you’d not be quite so set
up with ’em.”</p>

<p>The tone of conviction disconcerted the fair canvasser.
Somehow she had not expected it. In the course of her
present ministrations it was the first time she had met
that point of view. Laxton’s working-class, which
for several days had been honored by her delicate flatteries,
had shown such a robust faith in itself and had
purred so responsively to her blandishments that she
now took for granted that in all circumstances it would
fully share her own enthusiasm for it. But this rubicund,
coatless Briton, with eyes of half truculent humor,
was a little beyond her. Gloves were needed to handle
him; otherwise fingers of such flowerlike delicacy stood
a chance of being bruised.</p>

<p>“May one ask what you have against them?” lisped
the people’s champion, opening large round eyes.</p>

<p>“Nothing particular, miss,” said Joe urbanely. “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
you ask me whether I believe in ’em and I say I don’t.
Mind you, the people are all right in their place. I’ve
not a word to say against ’em personally. Of a Monday
morning at Vine Street, when the Court has been swep’
an’ dusted and his Worship has returned from his Sunday
in the country, we always try to make ’em welcome.
‘Let ’em all come,’ that’s the motto of the Metropolitan
Force. But as for <i>believing</i> in ’em, that’s another story.”</p>

<p>This was rather baffling for the people’s champion.
She was at a loss. But her faith was sublime. This
odd, crass, heavy-witted plebeian who denied his kind was
a sore problem even for the bringer of the light. Still,
she stuck to her guns gallantly.</p>

<p>“‘Government of the people, by the people, for the
people.’” Lisping the battle cry of Demos she returned
stoutly to the charge. Sacred formulas flowed from her
lips in a stream of charming pellucidity.</p>

<p>“Ah, you don’t know ’em, miss,” ejaculated Joe, at
intervals.</p>

<p>It was a pretty joust; vicarious enthusiasm on the one
side, first-hand experience on the other. But Joe was
a rock. The fair canvasser took forth every weapon
of an elegantly-furnished armory, yet without avail.</p>

<p>“I don’t hold with the people, miss, not in no shape
nor form.”</p>

<p>The tone was so final that at last a sense of defeat
came upon this Amazon. She was still seated, however,
without having quite made up her mind to the inevitable,
on her grand chair in the front sitting-room of Number
Five, Beaconsfield Villas, when Fate intervened in quite
a remarkable way.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, there appeared on the threshold of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
open door a figure tall, fine and unheralded. It was that
of Harriet Sanderson.</p>

<p>“Anybody at home?” she inquired gayly.</p>

<p>The unexpected visitor was looking very handsome
and distinguished in a well-cut black coat and skirt, and
a large hat too plain for fashion, but very far from
<i>démodé</i>. She came into the room with that almost proprietary
air she was never without in her intercourse
with her own people. But it was about to suffer an
eclipse.</p>

<p>Harriet just had time to greet her brother-in-law with
a happy mingling of the <i>bon camarade</i> and the woman of
the world, her fixed attitude towards such an Original,
whom somehow she could not help liking and respecting,
when her eyes met suddenly those of the fair canvasser.</p>

<p>For a moment an intense surprise forbade either to
speak. But the people’s champion was the first to overcome
the shock.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Sanderson!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>The change in Harriet was immediate and dramatic.</p>

<p>“Lady Muriel!” A slight flush of a fine face accompanied
the tone of awe.</p>

<p>The visitor rose. And in the act of so doing an accession
of great ladyhood, almost entirely absent a few
minutes ago, seemed automatically to enter her manner.</p>

<p>“What a small world it is!” she laughed. “Fancy
meeting you here!”</p>

<p>By now the iron will of the secretly annoyed and oddly
discomposed Harriet was able to reassert itself.</p>

<p>“It is a small world, my lady.” The tone was a very
delicate mingling of aloofness and respect.</p>

<p>Brief explanations followed. These quickly culminated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
in the presentation of Joe, who then became the
most embarrassed of the three. Unawares and in his
shirt sleeves, he had been entertaining an angel. And to
one of Conservative views, with a profound reverence
for law, order and all established things, this seemed to
verge upon indecency. A mere “one of Scotchie’s lady
canvassers” had been magically transformed, in the
twinkling of an eye, into Lady Muriel Dinneford, the
third daughter of one whom Number Five, Beaconsfield
Villas, always alluded to as “his Grace.”</p>

<p class="ph2">II</p>

<p>It was the work of a few tactful minutes for Lady
Muriel to effect a discreet retirement from the scene.
Yet so deeply had she been engaged by Joe’s contumacy,
and at the back of a mind which was making the most
heroic efforts to be “broad” was such a sense of amusement,
that she declared her intention of returning anon
with the People’s Candidate, if he could possibly spare
a few minutes from his multifarious duties, in order that
the <i>coup de grâce</i> might be given to Mr. Kelly’s dangerous
heresies.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of the distinguished visitor across the
street to the Candidate’s committee room left a void
which for a few tense moments only wonder could fill.</p>

<p>It was Joe who broke the silence which, like a pall,
had suddenly descended upon the front parlor of Number
Five.</p>

<p>“If that don’t beat Banagher,” he said. “Fancy one
of the Fam’ly taking the trouble to come a canvassin’
for Scotchie!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>Keen humor and acute annoyance contended now in
the eloquent face of Harriet.</p>

<p>“Pray, why shouldn’t she canvass for Sir Dugald
Maclean”&mdash;the level voice was pitched in a very quiet
key&mdash;“if she really believes in his principles?”</p>

<p>“How can she believe in ’em, gal?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“How can a blue blood believe in that sort of a feller?”</p>

<p>“Sir Dugald is a remarkably clever man. One of
the cleverest men in England, some people think.”</p>

<p>“That’s nothing to do with the matter. It’s character
that counts.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing against his character, I believe. At
any rate, Lady Muriel is going to marry him.”</p>

<p>The state of Joe’s feelings forbade an immediate reply.
And when reply he did, it was in a tone of scorn. Said
he: “‘Government of the people, by the people, for the
people!’ Harriet, for a dead beat fool give me a blue
blood aristocrat.”</p>

<p>“Joe,” came the answer, with a gleam of humor and
malice, “I really think you should learn to speak of our
governing class a little more respectfully.”</p>

<p>This was rather hard. She ought to have realized that
it was because Joe respected them so much that he now
desired to chasten them.</p>

<p>“Scotchie of all people!” he muttered.</p>

<p>“There’s no accounting for taste, you know.” There
was a sudden flash of a very handsome pair of eyes.</p>

<p>“O’ course there ain’t,” said Joe, sorrowfully malicious.
“You may have forgot there was a time when
Scotchie came a-courtin’ you.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose I am ever likely to forget it!” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
Harriet, with a cool cynicism which took the simple
Joseph completely out of his depth.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a queer world, I must say.”</p>

<p>“It is,” his sister-in-law agreed.</p>

<p>At that moment, Eliza came into the room. The
visit of Harriet was so unexpected as to take her by
surprise. But the cause of it was soon disclosed. Harriet
was troubled about Mary. Ever since the girl,
against the wishes and advice of her friends, had taken
what they felt to be a fatal step, there had been a gradual
drifting apart. Harriet had kept in touch with her as
well as she could, but she had not been able to stifle
her own private fears. The peril of such a career, even
when crowned by success, was in her opinion, difficult
to exaggerate. She disapproved of the friendship
with the Wrens, and had strongly opposed Mary’s living
with them. But as the girl rose in her profession,
Harriet’s hold upon her grew still less. And now at
second and third hand had come news which had greatly
upset her.</p>

<p>With the tact for which she was famous, Harriet
did not speak of this in the presence of Joe. She accompanied
Eliza to the privacy of the best bedroom, ostensibly
to “take off her things,” but really to discuss a
matter which for the past week had filled her with misgiving.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Joe in the parlor set himself doggedly
to compass the nap that so far had been denied him.
In spite of the noises in the street and romantic appearance
of a real live member of the Family in his
humble abode, he had just begun to doze when the ban of
Fate fell once more upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>From the strange welter in the amazing world outside
there now emerged a large open motor. And royally it
drew up before the magic door of Number Five. Two
persons were seated in the car. One was no less than
Princess Bedalia. The other was the humblest and yet
the boldest of her adorers.</p>

<p class="ph2">III</p>

<p>The idea itself had been Mary’s that they should use
a fine afternoon in motoring into Laxton, in order to see
her parents. Behind this simple plan was fell design.
A week had passed since that conversation under the
trees in the Park in which she had sought in vain for
her release. But so shallow had her reasoning appeared
that Jack declined to take it seriously. He had her
promise, and he felt he had every right to hold her to
it. Unless she could show a real cause for revoking it,
he was fully determined not to give her up.</p>

<p>In desperation, therefore, she had hit on the expedient,
a poor and vain one, no doubt, of taking him to see those
humble people whom she called father and mother. In the
course of her twenty odd years up and down the world
she had had intimations from various side winds and
divers little birds that she was an adopted child. Her
real parentage and the circumstances of her birth were
an impenetrable mystery and must always be so, no
doubt, but her feeling for the Kellys was one of true affection
and perfect loyalty. Not by word or deed had
she hinted at the possession of knowledge which had
come to her from other sources.</p>

<p>In the circumstances of the case she now allowed herself
to imagine that a visit to her home people in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
native habit as they dwelt might help to cure Jack of his
infatuation. An insight into things and men told her that
Beaconsfield Villas must be whole worlds away from any
sphere in which he had moved hitherto. Nor would he
be likely to suspect, as she was shrewdly aware, that a
creature so sophisticated as herself had risen from such
humble beginnings. She had a ferocious pride of her
own, but it was not of the kind that meanly denies
its origin.</p>

<p>“Father,” was her gay greeting to the astonished and
still coatless Joe, “I’ve brought somebody to see you.”</p>

<p>Jack, wearing a dustcoat and other appurtenances of
the chauffeur’s craft, had followed upon the heels of
Princess Bedalia into the front parlor of Number Five.
In response to the young man’s bow, Kelly offered a
rather dubious hand. As became a symbol of law and
order and a member of the straitest sect of the Pharisees,
he didn’t feel inclined to encourage Mary in gallivanting
up and down the land. Nor did he feel inclined to give
countenance to any promiscuous young man she might
bring to the house.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dinneford&mdash;my father, Police-Sergeant Kelly.”
It was a delightfully formal introduction, but rather
wickedly contrived.</p>

<p>Jack was so taken aback that he felt as if a feather
might have downed him. But even to the lynx eyes of
Mary, which were covertly upon him, not a trace of his
feelings was visible. He merely bowed a second time,
perhaps a little more gravely than the first.</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you, sir,” said Sergeant Kelly, in
a voice which showed pretty clearly that he was overstating
the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>Mary could not repress the rogue’s laugh that sprang
to her lips.</p>

<p>“Where’s my old mumsie?” she gayly demanded, partly
in the hope of concealing her wicked merriment.</p>

<p>“Upstairs with your Aunty Harriet.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Harriet here!” The tone was full of surprise.
And then the charming voice took a turn affectionately
non-committal. “What luck! It seems an age since I
saw her.”</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Joe could not help being a little in
awe of the girl. She was so remarkably striking that
every time he saw her it became harder to keep up the
pretense of blood relationship. She had developed into
the finest young woman he had ever met. Her official
father was very proud of her, the affection she inspired
in him was true and real, but at the moment he was
more than a little embarrassed by the impact of an
immensely distinguished personality.</p>

<p>However, in spite of such beauty and charm, he was
determined to do his duty by her; as became a father and
a man he felt bound to admonish her.</p>

<p>“Since you took up with those people, none of us
have been seeing much of you,” he forced himself to say,
in his most magisterial manner.</p>

<p>“Old story!”</p>

<p>“It’s true and you know it.” Joe declined on principle
to be softened by her blandishments.</p>

<p>“Wicked old story!” She took him by the shoulders
and shook him; and then she sighed as a mother might
have done, and gazed into his solemn face. “Father,”
she said, “you are an old and great dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“Get along with you!” said Joe sternly, but in spite of
himself he couldn’t help laughing.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave you and Mr. Dinneford to have a little crack
while I take this to my mumsie.” Brandishing an important-looking
milliner’s box, she left the room in a laughing
search of Eliza.</p>

<p>As soon as Jack found himself alone with Mary’s
father a period of constraint ensued. It would have
been wrong to deny that his reception had been the reverse
of cordial. The sensitiveness of a lover, in duty
bound to walk delicately, made no secret of that. Moreover,
he was still so astonished at Mary’s paternity that
he felt quite at a loss. Nature had played an amazing
trick. Somehow this serio-comic London copper in half-mufti,
was going to make it very difficult to exercise
the deference due to a prospective father-in-law.</p>

<p>An acute silence was terminated by Joe’s “Won’t you
sit down, sir?”</p>

<p>Jack sat down; and then Mary’s father, torn between
stern disapproval and the humane feelings of a host,
invited the young man solemnly to a glass of beer.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” said Jack, with admirable
gravity.</p>

<p>Murmuring “excuse me a minute,” Joe went to draw
the beer. Left alone the young man tried to arrange
his thoughts; also he took further stock of his surroundings.
He had yet to overcome a powerful feeling of surprise.
It was hard to believe that Princess Bedalia, in
the view of her <i>fiancé</i>, the very last word in modern
young women, should have sprung from such a <i>milieu</i>
as Number Five, Beaconsfield Villas. It was a facer.
Yet somehow the chasm between Mary and her male<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
parent seemed almost to enhance her value. She was so
superb an original that she defied the laws of nature.</p>

<p>The young man was engulfed in an odd train of speculation
when Mary’s father returned with the beer. He
poured out two glasses, gave one to the visitor, took
one himself, and after a solemn “Good health, sir!”
solemnly drank it.</p>

<p>Jack returned the “Good health!” and followed the
rest of the ritual. And then feeling rather more his
own man, he made an effort to come to business. But
it was only possible to do that by means of a directness
verging upon the indelicate.</p>

<p>“Sergeant Kelly,” he said, “have you any objection
to my marrying Mary?”</p>

<p>No doubt the form of the question was a little unwise.
At least it exposed the young man to the prompt rejoinder:</p>

<p>“I know nothing whatever about you, sir.”</p>

<p>“My name is Dinneford”&mdash;he could not refrain from
laughing a little at the portentous gravity of a prospective
father-in-law. “And I think I can claim that I have
always passed as respectable.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it, sir,” said Joe, the light of a respectful
humor breaking upon him. And then measuring
the young man with the eye of professional experience.
“May I ask your occupation?”</p>

<p>“No occupation.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the sound o’ that.” Sergeant Kelly sagely
shook his head.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it isn’t quite so bad as it sounds,” said the
young man. “At present, you see, I am a kind of understudy
to a sort of uncle I have. I am in training as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
you might say, so that one day I may follow in his
footsteps.”</p>

<p>“An actor,” said the dubious Joe. He didn’t mind
actors personally, but impersonally he didn’t quite hold
with the stage.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” said the young man coolly, but with
a smile. “And yet he is in his way. In fact, you might
call him a prince of comedians.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, sir.” Sergeant Kelly measured each word
carefully. “But I’m afraid that’s only a very little in
his favor.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, too,” said Jack. “My uncle is a duke,
and the deuce of it is, I have to succeed him.”</p>

<p>“A duke!” Sergeant Kelly’s tone of rather pained
surprise made it clear that such a romantic circumstance
greatly altered the aspect of the case. It also implied
that he was far from approving an ill-timed jest
on a sacred subject. His brow knitted to a heavy frown.
“Well, sir, I can only say that if such is the case you
have no right to come a-courting our Mary.”</p>

<p>“For why not, Sergeant Kelly?”</p>

<p>“You know why not, sir, as well as I do. She’s a
fine gal, although I say it who ought not, but that will
not put her right with your friends. They will expect
you to take a wife of your own sort.”</p>

<p>“But that’s rather my look-out, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it is,” said Joe, with the air of a warrior,
“but as you have asked me, there’s my opinion. The
aristocracy’s the aristocracy, the middle-class is the middle-class,
and the lower orders are the lower orders&mdash;there
they are and you can’t alter ’em. At least, that’s
my view of the matter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>Jack forced a wry smile. Mary was a chip of the old
block. Such an uncompromising statement seemed at
any rate to explain the force of her conviction upon
this vexed subject.</p>

<p>“Excuse the freedom, sir,” said the solemn Joe, “but
you young nobs who keep on marrying out of your
class are undermining the British Constitution. What’s
to become of law and order if you go on mixing things
up in the way you are doing?”</p>

<p>The young man proceeded to do battle with the
Philistine. But the weapons in his armory were none
of the brightest with which to meet the crushing onset of
the foe.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, sir. As I say, the aristocracy’s the aristocracy,
the middle-class is the middle-class, and the
lower orders are the lower orders&mdash;there they are and
you can’t alter ’em. You don’t suppose I’ve reggerlated
the traffic at Hyde Park Corner all these years
not to know <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>In the presence of such a conviction, the best of Jack’s
arguments seemed vain, futile and shallow. Fate had
charged Joseph Kelly with the solemn duty of maintaining
the fabric of society, and in his purview, no argument
however cunning, could set that fact aside.</p>

<p class="ph2">IV</p>

<p>While these two were still at grips, each meeting the
arguments of the other with a sense of growing impatience,
the cause of the trouble intervened. Mary came
into the room, leading her mother by the hand. With
the face of a sphinx followed Harriet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>The blushing Eliza was adorned with a fine coat which
had come in the milliner’s box. Mary had laughingly
insisted on her mother appearing in it, in spite of Eliza’s
firm conviction that “it was much too grand.”</p>

<p>“My word, mother!” roared Joe, at the sight of her
splendor. “I’m thinking I’ll have to keep an eye on
<i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>The visitor was promptly introduced, first to the wearer
of the coat, who offered a shy and embarrassed hand,
and then to Aunt Harriet, who stood mute and pale
in the background.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, Mrs. Sanderson,” said the young man,
“fancy meeting you here!”</p>

<p>“You have met before?” said Mary, innocently.</p>

<p>“We meet very often.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. Mrs. Sanderson is Uncle Albert’s right
hand at Bridport House.”</p>

<p>A pin might have been heard to fall in the silence that
followed. The blood fled from Mary’s cheeks; they
grew as pale as those of her aunt. Even the knowledge
that had recently come to her had not connected Jack
with Bridport House. No attempt had been made to
realize exactly who and what he was. It had been
enough that he belonged to a world beyond her own.
And now as this new and astonishing fact presented
itself she saw the strongest possible justification for the
attitude she had taken up.</p>

<p>As for Harriet, stern and unbending in the background,
she was like an Antigone who abides the decree. Her
fears were realized. The worst had happened. Fate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
had played such a subtle and unworthy trick that the
instinct uppermost was to resent it bitterly.</p>

<p>The feelings of the girl were very similar. But her
strength of character and the independence of her position
enabled her to take charge of a situation delicate
and embarrassing. In a rather high-pitched voice, she
began to talk generalities in order to bridge if possible
the arid pauses which were always threatening to submerge
the conversation. But at the back of her mind
was a growing sense that secret forces are always at
work in this strange world we inhabit&mdash;forces which
have a peculiar malice of their own.</p>

<p>And yet, hopeless as the position had suddenly become
for these five people, the fates had one more barb
in their quiver. And it was of so odd a kind that it
was as if the stars in their courses were bent upon
seeing what mischief they could contrive in this particular
matter. A sudden sharp rap from the knocker of the
front door fell into the midst of the growing embarrassment.
Joe, welcoming this diversion as relief to a
tension that was almost intolerable, went at once to
attend the cause of it.</p>

<p>“As I’m a living man,” came a lusty voice from the
threshold, “if it isn’t old Joe Kelly.”</p>

<p>The People’s Candidate, rosetted, dauntless and triumphant,
accompanied by the lady of his choice, stepped
heroically into the small room. Twenty-three years had
wrought a very remarkable change in a very remarkable
man. In that time Dugald Maclean had bent all the
powers of his genius to a task that Miss Harriet Sanderson
had discreetly imposed upon the author of “Urban
Love, a Trilogy.” And now he came in, every inch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
a victor, he had not looked to find his monitress. But
there she was, pale, grim, yet somehow oddly distinguished
in the background of a room curiously familiar.
It was to her that his eyes leapt.</p>

<p>“Why, Miss Sanderson!” he said, with a conqueror’s
laugh, in which there was no trace of the tongue-tied
youth of three and twenty years ago. Offering a conqueror’s
hand, he went forward to greet her.</p>

<p>Harriet yielded hers with a vivid blush. And as she
did so, she was suddenly aware of two swordlike orbs
piercing her right through.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know Mrs. Sanderson was a friend of
yours,” said the honeyed voice of Lady Muriel.</p>

<p>“A very old friend,” said Sir Dugald gayly.</p>

<p>At that moment, however, it was necessary for Lady
Muriel to curb her curiosity. Since her exit from that
room half-an-hour ago other people had gathered in it.
She had hardly spoken when her astonished eyes fell
upon Cousin Jack. Their recognition of each other was
mutually incredulous. Yet there was really no reason
why it should have been. It was known to the young
man that Muriel had been refused permission to marry
a politician already on the high road to place and power,
and it was known to her that Jack had been going about
with an actress.</p>

<p>“A family party,” said Jack, as their eyes met. “Let
me introduce Miss Lawrence&mdash;Lady Muriel Dinneford.”</p>

<p>An exchange of aloof bows followed. And then,
although very careful to seem to do nothing of the kind,
each measured the other with an eye as hard and bright
as a diamond. To neither was the result of this scrutiny
exactly pleasant. It came upon Cousin Muriel with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
little shock of surprise that “the Chorus Girl” should
look just as she did, and that she knew how to bear
herself in a way that did not yield an inch to the
enemy, yet at the same time scrupulously refrained from
offering battle. Here was beauty of a very compelling
kind, and in the hostile view of its present beholder
something more valuable. The distinguished air, the look
of breeding, went some way to excuse a deplorable infatuation.
But as far as “the Chorus Girl” herself was concerned,
a little over-sensitive as circumstances may have
made her on the score of her own dignity, it was far from
pleasant to detect in this authentic member of the family
that power of conveying subtle insult, without speech
or look, which belonged to the two others, presumably
her sisters, whom she had met in the Park.</p>

<p>Somehow the girl felt a keen rage within. It may
have been the world of unconscious arrogance behind
that aloof nod, it may have been the implicit challenge
in the lidded glance down the long straight nose. But
whatever the cause, Mary suddenly felt a surge of
resentment in her very bones.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the People’s Candidate was playing
his part to perfection. The flight of time had wrought
wonders in this champion of Demos. He was no longer
tongue-tied and awkward; even the roll of his “r’s” was
so diminished that Ardnaleuchan would hardly have
known its child. Everything was in perfect harmony.
After a few brief passages with Harriet, audaciously
humorous, in which homage was paid to old times, he
turned with a sportsman’s eye to exchange a ready quip
with Joe and Eliza.</p>

<p>Joe, in his heart, was scandalized. A Tory to the bone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
in his view the social hierarchy was part of the cosmic
order. It was unchanging, immutable. “Scotchie” was
a charlatan, tongue in cheek; a mountebank of a fellow
whom it was amazing that honest men, let alone high-born
women, could not see through. Joe was determined
to have no truck with him, but the People’s
Candidate with a bonhomie which the former colleague
of the X Division was inclined to regard as mere brazenness,
seemed quite determined not to take rebuffs from
an old friend.</p>

<p>“You haven’t a vote, Joe, I know,” said Maclean, “but
you are a man of influence here and I want you to
speak for me with your pals.”</p>

<p>Joe shook a solemn head.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in your principles,” said he.</p>

<p>The voice, a growl of indignation, struck the ear of
Lady Muriel a veritable blow. In spite of “the breadth”
she was trying so hard to cultivate, the laws of her
being demanded that these humble people should grovel.
They were of another caste, another clay; somehow
Joe’s blunt skepticism gave her a sense of personal
affront.</p>

<p>“You have not a vote, Mr. Kelly,” she interposed, in
a sharp tone. “Pray, why didn’t you tell me? A canvasser’s
time is valuable.”</p>

<p>“Your ladyship never asked the question.”</p>

<p>“But you knew, surely, my object in coming?”</p>

<p>“I did,” said Joe coolly, with a slightly humorous air.
“And I thought your ladyship so dangerous that the
best thing I could do was to get you barking up the
wrong tree.”</p>

<p>The answer delighted Maclean. He threw up his head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
and laughed like a school boy. But in the midst of a
mirth that his fiancée was quite incapable of sharing
with him, Jack and Mary rose to go. They had been
waiting to seize the first chance which offered in order
to escape from a decidedly irksome family party.</p>

<p class="ph2">V</p>

<p>As Mary and Jack took leave, the penetrating eye
of the new Home Secretary regarded them. The two
men had not met before, but they were known to each
other by hearsay. Jack had heard little good of Maclean&mdash;Sir
Dugald had heard even less good of Jack. A light
of amused malice sprang to their eyes in the moment
of recognition. But from those of the Scotsman it
quickly passed. For almost at once his attention was
caught by the affectionate intimacy of the good-bys bestowed
upon Joe, Eliza, and Harriet by a girl of quite
remarkable interest.</p>

<p>Was it possible? The live thought flashed through
Sir Dugald’s mind. In an instant it had leapt to the
November evening of the year 1890. Immense quantities
of water had flowed under the bridge since that
far distant hour. And if this vivid, unforgettable girl
was the creature he now suspected that she must be,
here was one example the more of the romance of
time, nature and circumstance.</p>

<p>As soon as Mary and Jack were away on what they
called a joy-ride to Richmond, all Sir Dugald’s doubts
in the matter were laid at rest. At once there followed
a few brief, but pitiless and bitter passages between
Harriet Sanderson and Lady Muriel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me, Mrs. Sanderson,” said the younger woman
in a tone of ice, “is Miss Lawrence a connection of
yours?”</p>

<p>“My niece, my lady,” said Harriet, an odd tremor in
her voice.</p>

<p>“A daughter, I presume, of your sister and her husband?”</p>

<p>“That is so, my lady.” Harriet’s tone was slowly
deepening to that of her questioner.</p>

<p>“Of course, the matter will have to be mentioned at
once to my father. And I’m afraid the consequences
cannot fail to be serious. You must feel that it is
very wrong to have connived at such a state of things.”</p>

<p>Harriet’s reply, brief but considered, made with a sudden
flush of color and a lighted eye, was a cold denial.
It was a short but painful scene, and its three witnesses
would gladly have been spared it. Lady Muriel
had lost a little of her poise. In spite of her “breadth”
she was simply horrified by her discovery. She could
not believe that Harriet spoke the truth. And the cunning,
the duplicity, the chicane of a retainer who had
held a privileged position for so many years filled her
with an inward fury that was almost beyond control.</p>

<p>“One could not have believed it to be possible,” she
said, in a voice that trembled ominously. And having
discharged that Parthian bolt, she withdrew with the
People’s Candidate in order to canvass the next house
in the street.</p>

<p class="ph2">VI</p>

<p>Such a departure left consternation in its train. After
a moment of complete silence, Eliza burst into a sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
flood of tears, Joe put on his tunic with the air of a
tragedian, but Harriet remained immovable as a statue.</p>

<p>“This comes of the stage,” wailed poor Eliza.</p>

<p>Joe felt the times themselves were to blame, at any rate
they were sadly out of joint.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what things are coming to,” he said,
flinging his slippers into a corner and putting on his
boots. “Things are all upside down these days and no
mistake.”</p>

<p>Harriet blamed no one. She merely stood white and
shaken, a picture of tragic unhappiness.</p>

<p>“Gal,” said Joe, turning to her a Job’s comforter, “one
thing is sure. You are going to lose your place.”</p>

<p>Harriet bit her lip, coldly disdaining a reply.</p>

<p>“As sure as eggs that’ll be the upshot,” proceeded Joe.
“I’m sorry I let that jockey go without giving him a
bit of my mind.”</p>

<p>“He is not to blame,” said Harriet tensely.</p>

<p>“Who is, then?”</p>

<p>“You and me, Joe,” sobbed Eliza, “for letting her
go on the stage.”</p>

<p>“There was no stopping her&mdash;you know that well
enough. As soon as she took up her dancing we lost
all control of her. But we’ve got to be pretty sensible
now. A nice tangle things are in, and they’ll take a bit
of straightening out.”</p>

<p>Harriet shook a mournful head.</p>

<p>“What can people like ourselves possibly do?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I’ve a great mind,” said Joe, “to step as far as
Bridport House and have a few words with his Grace.”</p>

<p>“That’s merely preposterous,” said Harriet decisively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“The matter must be brought to his notice at once,
any way,” said Joe doggedly.</p>

<p>“You can count upon that,” said Harriet grimly.</p>

<p>“But it’ll be one side only. And there’s the other,
my gal.”</p>

<p>“What other?” Harriet asked with a drawn smile.</p>

<p>“Her side. She is not going to be made a fool of by
anyone if I can help it.”</p>

<p>Said Harriet very gravely: “Joe, I sincerely hope
you will not meddle in this. I am quite sure that
any interference of ours will be most unwise.”</p>

<p>But Joe shook the head of a warrior.</p>

<p>“There you’re wrong. This is our affair and we’ve
got to see it through.”</p>

<p>“Far better let the matter alone.”</p>

<p>“When we adopted that girl,” said Joe, “we took a
great responsibility on ourselves, and we’ve got to live
up to it. In my opinion that young man means no
good.”</p>

<p>“You have no right to say that,” said Harriet quickly.</p>

<p>“I’ve a right to say what I think. And you know as
well as I do that the likes o’ him don’t condescend to the
likes o’ her with any good intention.”</p>

<p>Harriet flushed darkly.</p>

<p>“I am quite sure that Mr. Dinneford would always
behave like a gentleman,” she said sternly.</p>

<p>“That is more than you know.”</p>

<p>“You seem to forget that he is one of the Family.”</p>

<p>Joe laughed rather sardonically. “I don’t blame you
for being so set up with your precious Family,” he said.
“It is only right that you should be&mdash;but I know what
I know. Human nature’s human nature.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>Harriet shook her head. Not for a moment could
she accept this point of view. Moreover, she strongly
urged that there must not be interference of any kind
with Bridport House.</p>

<p>“That’s as may be,” said Joe stoutly. “But you can
take your oath that I mean to see justice done in the
matter.”</p>

<p>“You talk as if she was your own daughter,” said
Harriet, who was growing deeply annoyed.</p>

<p>“Ever since I gave her my name and my roof, I have
looked on her as a gal of my own.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that we have,” chimed Eliza tearfully. “And
I am sure that Joe is right to take the matter up.”</p>

<p>Again Harriet dissented. In her view, and she did
not hesitate to express it forcibly, it would be sheer folly
for people like themselves to meddle in such a delicate
affair.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said Eliza bitterly, “that rather than
go against Bridport House, you would ruin the girl.”</p>

<p>The words struck home. Eliza had long looked up
to her younger sister. The position she held was one
of honor, but Harriet’s exaggerated concern for an
imposing machine of which she was no more than a very
humble cog, somehow aroused Eliza’s deepest feelings.</p>

<p>“It is a very wicked thing to say.” And in the eyes
of Harriet was an odd look.</p>

<p>“You set these grandees above everything in the
world,” Eliza taunted. “Like the Dad, you simply worship
them.”</p>

<p>A deadly pallor overspread Harriet’s face. Her
eyes grew grim with pain and anger. But a powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
nature, schooled to self-discipline, fought for control and
was able to gain it.</p>

<p>“It’s a futile discussion,” she said suddenly, in a
changed tone. And then she added with an earnestness
strangely touching. “Joe, I implore you not to take any
step in the matter without first consulting me.”</p>

<p>The solemn words seemed to gain finality from the
fact that Harriet Sanderson then walked abruptly out
of the house.</p>

PLOT AND COUNTERPLOT</h2></div>

<p class="ph2">I</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Duke</span>, in his morning-room, was reading a
letter which had just come to him by post. As
he folded it neatly and returned it to an envelope
which bore the stamp of the south-eastern postal district,
the light of humor played over an expressive face. And
when, after much reflection, he took the letter again from
its envelope and solemnly re-read it, the look deepened to
the verge of the saturnine.</p>

<p>Still pondering what he plainly considered to be
a priceless document, a succession of odd grimaces caused
him to purse his lips and to frown perplexedly. At last
he dropped his glasses and broke into a guffaw.</p>

<p>Lying back in his invalid’s chair, still in the throes
of an infrequent laughter, he was presently brought back
to the plane of gravity by the unexpected arrival of
Lady Wargrave upon the scene.</p>

<p>She entered the room with a gladiatorial air.</p>

<p>The face of his Grace underwent a sudden change at
the sight of this unwelcome visitor.</p>

<p>Charlotte seated herself ponderously. And then having
allowed a moment’s pause for dramatic effect, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
said, marking her brother with an intent eye, “The plot
thickens.”</p>

<p>“Plot?” he said, warily.</p>

<p>“Do you wish me to believe that you have not heard
the latest development?”</p>

<p>“Why speak in riddles, Charlotte?” He was trying
to suppress a growing irritability.</p>

<p>Charlotte smiled frostily. “One should make allowances,
no doubt, for natural simplicity. But even to
the aloofness of philosophers there’s a limit, my friend.
You must know that there is only one subject in all
our minds just now.”</p>

<p>The Duke, a concentrated gaze upon Charlotte, did
not allow himself to admit anything of the kind. For
one thing they were lifelong adversaries. Charlotte was
a meddlesome woman, an intriguer and a busybody in the
sacred name of Family. They had tried many a fall
with each other in the past, and although Providence in
making Albert John the head of the house had given
him an unfair advantage, he was often hard set by Charlotte’s
malice and persistency.</p>

<p>“Have you spoken to that young wretch?” Charlotte
lost no time in coming boldly to the horses.</p>

<p>“I have not,” was the sour reply.</p>

<p>“Is it quite wise, do you think, to let the grass grow
under your feet?&mdash;particularly having regard to the fact
that the person happens to be a niece of Mrs. Sanderson’s.”
This was a very shrewd blow, whose manner
of delivery had been most carefully considered beforehand.
Indeed, so neatly was it planted now that his
Grace got the shock of his life. The surprise was so
painfully sharp that he found it hard to meet the foe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
without flinching. He had to make a great effort to
hold himself in hand. And Charlotte, a cold eye upon
him, followed up in an extremely businesslike manner.
She had a very strong hand to play and a true warrior,
if ever there was one, she was set on wringing out
of it the last ounce of advantage. There had come to
her at last, after many a year of watching and waiting,
an opportunity beyond her hopes and her prayers.</p>

<p>“Last evening poor Sarah came to me in great distress,”
proceeded Charlotte. “Muriel, it appears, had
been electioneering in the constituency of a certain person,
and in the course of her wanderings up and down
the suburbs, she found herself quite by chance at the
house of Mrs. Sanderson’s brother-in-law.”</p>

<p>By this time his Grace had sufficiently recovered from
the blow that had been dealt him to ask how Muriel had
contrived to make that particular discovery.</p>

<p>It seemed that she had found Mrs. Sanderson there.</p>

<p>“The long arm of coincidence,” opined his Grace with
a wry smile. He opined further that the whole thing
began to sound uncommonly like a novel.</p>

<p>“Sober reality, I assure you, Johnnie. And sober
reality can beat any novel in the power of the human
mind to invent, that’s why it’s so stupid to write them.
Muriel entered the house by chance, Mrs. Sanderson
came there, and presently, if you please, Master Jack
arrived by motor with the young person. By the way,
Muriel says she is very good looking.”</p>

<p>“Quite a family party.” His Grace achieved a light
tone with difficulty. “But I incline to think, Charlotte,
you a little overstate the facts.”</p>

<p>“It is the story Muriel told Sarah.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I am very unwilling to believe that Mrs. Sanderson
knew what was going on.”</p>

<p>“Pray, why not?” He was raked by a goshawk’s
eye.</p>

<p>“She would have told me.”</p>

<p>Somehow those lame, impotent words revealed a man
badly hit. Charlotte saw that at once, and forthwith
proceeded to turn the fact to pitiless advantage. A
gust of coarse laughter swept the room.</p>

<p>“Johnnie, it’s the first time I’ve read you a fool.
Simple Simon! Do you think a woman who has learned
to play her cards like that is the one to give away
her hand?”</p>

<p>This was a second blow planted neatly on the vizor
of his Grace. In spite of his armor of cynicism he
could be seen to wince a little. And the silence which
followed enabled the implacable foe to perceive that he
was shaken worse than it seemed reasonable to expect
him to be.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll now permit her to be sent away. A
sordid intriguer. She must go at once.”</p>

<p>In the trying moment which followed, the Duke, badly
hipped, fought valiantly to pull himself together. But
somehow he only just managed to do so.</p>

<p>“You make a mistake, Charlotte,” he said, with an
effort that clearly hurt him. “She is not that kind of
person. You always have made that mistake. She is a
superior woman in every way. At least, I have always
found her so. I can’t imagine such a woman intriguing
for anybody.”</p>

<p>“Shows how little you know ’em, Johnnie.” Another
Gargantuan gust swept the room. “Every woman intrigues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
unless she’s a born fool, and this housekeeper
nurse of yours is very far from being that&mdash;believe
me.”</p>

<p>For a brief, but uncomfortable moment the Duke
thought the matter over with an air of curious perplexity.
Then he said abruptly and with defiance:</p>

<p>“I must have further information.”</p>

<p>“Sarah has the details. It would be well, no doubt,
to have her views on the matter.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Charlotte rose massively, crossed to the
bell and rang it in order that a much tormented male
should enjoy this further privilege.</p>

<p class="ph2">II</p>

<p>The eldest daughter of the house, when she came
on the scene, found the atmosphere decidedly electric.
Her father was glaring with very ominous eyes; while
it was clear from the look on the face of Aunt Charlotte
that she was under the impression that she had
downed him at last. No doubt she had, but if those eyes
meant anything there was still a lot of fight in the stricken
warrior.</p>

<p>Sarah herself was a long, thin, flat-chested person.
Totally devoid of imagination, her horizon was so limited
that outside the Family nothing or nobody mattered.
And yet she was not in the least domesticated. In
fact, she was not in the least anything. She was nobly
and consistently null, without opinions or ideas, without
humor, charm or amenity. Her mental outlook had
somehow thrown back to the 1840’s, yet with all her
limitations, apart from which very little remained of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
her, she was a thoroughly sound, exceedingly honest
Christian gentlewoman of thirty-eight.</p>

<p>Sarah, it seemed, having heard Muriel’s story, had
taken counsel of the dowager. And at once realizing the
extreme gravity of the whole affair, both ladies determined
to make the most of a long-sought opportunity
to give the housekeeper her quietus. Sarah herself, who
was inclined to be embittered and vindictive on this particular
point, fell in only too readily with Aunt Charlotte’s
desire to take full advantage of such a golden
chance. Called upon now to divulge all that she knew,
the eldest daughter re-told Muriel’s remarkable story
of her meeting with Mrs. Sanderson, Jack and the girl,
in the course of political endeavors at Laxton. The
story, amazing as it was, was undoubtedly authentic.</p>

<p>“Of course, father,” was Sarah’s conclusion, very
pointedly expressed, “she will simply <i>have</i> to go. And
the sooner the better, as no doubt you agree.”</p>

<p>To Sarah’s deep annoyance, however, her sire seemed
very far from agreeing.</p>

<p>“There is no direct evidence of collusion,” he said.
“And knowing Mrs. Sanderson to be an old and tried
servant, who has always had our welfare at heart, I
am very unwilling to place such a construction upon what
may be no more than a rather odd coincidence.”</p>

<p>Sarah was too deeply angry to reply. But she looked
on grimly while the ruthless Charlotte showly marshaled
her forces. The quarrel was a very pretty one. Yet
the Duke, now his back was to the wall, was able to
take excellent care of himself. Moreover, he flatly declined
to hear a worthy woman traduced until she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
had a chance of meeting charges so recklessly, and as
it seemed, malevolently brought against her.</p>

<p>“From the way in which you speak of her,” said the
incensed Charlotte, “you appear to regard her as a person
of importance.”</p>

<p>“Charlotte, I regard her as thoroughly honest, trustworthy,
competent&mdash;in fact a good woman in every way.”</p>

<p>“You willfully blind yourself, Johnnie. This creature
has thrown dust in your eyes. But it will be no more
than you deserve if one day her niece is installed as mistress
here. You will not live to see it, yet it would be
no more than bare justice if you did.”</p>

<p>“Pernicious nonsense,” rejoined his Grace. “Perhaps
in the circumstances it would be well to hear what Mrs.
Sanderson has to say for herself.”</p>

<p>“She is bound to lie.”</p>

<p>Somehow the precision of the language stung his
Grace.</p>

<p>“You are not entitled to say that,” he flashed.</p>

<p>“It is the common sense of the situation and one has a
perfect right to express it.”</p>

<p>“Not here, Charlotte&mdash;not in this room before me. If
I trust people implicitly&mdash;there are not many that I do&mdash;I
trust them implicitly, and I can’t allow even <i>privileged</i>
people to speak of them in that way&mdash;at any rate, in my
presence.”</p>

<p>This explosion was so unlooked for that it took the
ladies aback. In all the years they had fought him
they had never seen him moved so deeply. A new
Albert John had suddenly emerged. Never before had the
head of the house allowed these enemies to catch a
glimpse of such quixotic, such fantastic chivalry. Charlotte<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
was sourly amused, Sarah, amazed; but both ladies
were deeply angry.</p>

<p>However, they had fully made up their minds that
the housekeeper must go. Indeed, that had been already
arranged at the after-dinner conference at Hill Street the
previous evening. They were convinced that a woman
whom they intensely disliked, whose peculiar position
they greatly resented, was at last driven into a corner.
The Duke’s indecently bold defense of her had taken
them by surprise, but it only made them the more determined
to push their present advantage ruthlessly home.</p>

<p class="ph2">III</p>

<p>Suddenly Sarah rose and pressed the bell. She demanded
of the servant who answered it that Mrs. Sanderson
should appear.</p>

<p>Harriet, already apprised of Lady Wargrave’s arrival,
came at once. She was quite prepared for a painful
scene. Only too well had she reason to know the
state of feeling in regard to herself. She had always
been so able and discreet that she had enforced the
outward respect of those whom she served so loyally.
But she well knew that she was not liked by the
ladies of the house, and that the special position she
had come to hold owing to the decline of the Duke’s
health, was a <i>casus belli</i> between him and the members
of his family. She had long been aware that in the
opinion of the Dinneford ladies it was no part of a
housekeeper’s functions to act as a trained nurse to their
invalid father.</p>

<p>Harriet had a natural awe of Lady Wargrave, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
she shared with all under that roof; for Lady Sarah
she had the deep respect which she extended to every
member of the august clan it had been her privilege
to serve for so many years. In the devout eyes of
Harriet Sanderson each unit of that clan was not as
other men and women. In the matter of Bridport House
and all that it stood for, she was more royalist than the
king.</p>

<p>From the dark hour, a week ago now, in which the
news had come by a side wind, that the fates by a
stroke of perverse cruelty, as it seemed, had thrown
Mary across the path of Mr. Dinneford, she had hardly
known how to lay her head on her pillow. To her
mind the whole thing was simply calamitous. It had
thrown her into a state of profound unhappiness. She
now came into the room looking worn and ill, yet fully
prepared for short shift to be meted out to her by
those whom she found assembled there.</p>

<p>The ladies looked for defiance, no doubt. And they
may have looked for an undercurrent of malicious triumph.
Yet if they expected either of these things their
mistake was at once very clear. It was hard to find a
trace of the successful intriguer in the haggard cheeks
and somber eyes of the woman before them. But to
minds such as theirs portents of this kind could not
be expected to weigh in the scale against their preconceived
ideas.</p>

<p>It was left to Lady Wargrave to fix the charge. And
this she did with a blunt precision which was itself
a form of insult. The icy tones were scrupulously
polite, nothing was said which one in her position was
not entitled to say in such circumstances, yet the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
effect was so deadly in its venom as to be absolutely
pitiless.</p>

<p>At first Harriet was overwhelmed. The force of the
attack was beyond anything she had looked for. Moreover,
it seemed to fill the Duke, an unwilling auditor,
with anger and pain. He moved uneasily in his chair,
yet he was not able to check the cold torrent of quasi-insult
by word of mouth, for none knew better than
Lady Wargrave how to administer castigation without
going outside the rules of the game.</p>

<p>Even when the shock of the first blows was past,
Harriet could find no means of defending herself. She
was a very proud woman. Her blamelessness in what
she could only regard as a very odious matter was so
clear to her own mind that it did not seem to call for
re-statement. She, too, said nothing. But a hot flush
came upon the thin cheek.</p>

<p>Lady Wargrave grew more and more incensed by a
silence, the cause of which she completely mistook.</p>

<p>“You have been nearly thirty years here, Mrs. Sanderson,
and you have been guilty of a wicked abuse of
trust.”</p>

<p>The painful pause which followed this final blow was
broken at last by the Duke.</p>

<p>“You must forgive me, Charlotte, if I say that the
facts of the case as they have been presented, hardly
justify such a statement.”</p>

<p>The tone was honey. And it was in such ironical
contrast to Charlotte’s own that nothing could have
shown more clearly the wide gulf between their points
of view or the envenomed strife of many years now coming
to a head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>“They prove the charge to the hilt.” The hawk’s eyes
of Charlotte contracted ominously.</p>

<p>“What charge?&mdash;if you don’t mind stating it explicitly.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Sanderson has used her position here to make
her niece known to the future head of this house, she
has connived at their intimacy, she appears to have fostered
it in every way.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you are entitled to say that, Charlotte.”
The Duke spoke slowly and pointedly, and then
he turned to Harriet with an air of such delicate politeness
that it added fuel to the flame which was withering
her traducers. “If it is not asking too much, Mrs. Sanderson,”
he said, with a smile of grave kindness, “I
should personally be very grateful if you would be
wicked enough to defend yourself. Let me say at once
that I am far from accepting the construction Lady
Wargrave has placed on the matter. But her zeal for a
time-honored institution is so great that if her judgment
is outrun, it seems only kind to forgive her.”</p>

<p>Such oblique but resounding blows in the sconce of
Charlotte filled her with a fury hard to hold in check.</p>

<p>“What defense is possible?” Her voice was like
a crane. “The facts are there to look at. Mrs. Sanderson’s
niece has extracted a promise of marriage.”</p>

<p>The Duke turned to Harriet rather anxiously.</p>

<p>“I sincerely hope Lady Wargrave has been misinformed,”
he said.</p>

<p>Harriet flushed.</p>

<p>“I only know”&mdash;speech for her had become almost
intolerably difficult&mdash;“that Mr. Dinneford has asked my
brother-in-law’s consent to his marrying her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>The Duke may have been deeply annoyed, but not a
line of his face betrayed him.</p>

<p>“Who is your brother-in-law, Mrs. Sanderson?”</p>

<p>Harriet told him.</p>

<p>“A very honest man”&mdash;the Duke checked a laugh&mdash;“I
have been honored by a letter from him this morning.”</p>

<p>Even the lacerated Harriet could not forbear to smile.</p>

<p>“I am sure,” said she, “he will not let Mary marry
Mr. Dinneford if he can help it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” sharply interposed Lady Wargrave.</p>

<p>“Why not, Charlotte?” Her brother took upon himself
to answer the question. “Because Sergeant Kelly
is a very sensible and enlightened man who evidently
tries to see things in their right relation.”</p>

<p>“Fiddle-de-dee!” said Charlotte, with the bluntness
for which she was famous. “Depend upon it, he knows
as well as anybody on which side his bread is buttered.”</p>

<p>Her brother shook his head. “I think,” he said, “if you
had had the privilege of reading Sergeant Kelly’s letter
you would be agreeably surprised. At any rate, he
seems quite to share your view of the sacredness of the
social fabric.”</p>

<p>“Let us look at the facts,” said Charlotte. “This
marriage has to be prevented at all costs. And I hope
it is not too much to ask Mrs. Sanderson that she will
give us any assistance which may lie in her power.”</p>

<p>The look upon Lady Wargrave’s face, as she made the
request, clearly implied that help from such a quarter
must, in the nature of things, be negligible. But in spite
of the covert insult in the tone and manner of the dowager,
Harriet replied very simply that there was nothing
she would leave undone to prevent such a catastrophe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“I am quite sure, Mrs. Sanderson, we can count upon
that,” said the Duke, in a tone which softened considerably
the humiliating silence with which the promise had
been received.</p>

<p>“To begin with,” said the Duke, turning to Harriet,
“I shall ask your brother-in-law to come and see me.
Evidently he is one of these sensible, straightforward
men who can be trusted to take a large view of things.”</p>

<p>The face of Lady Wargrave expressed less optimism.</p>

<p>“There is one question I would like to put to Mrs.
Sanderson,” she suddenly interposed. It seemed that she
had reserved for a final attack the weapon on which she
counted most. “Be good enough to tell me this.” The
ruthless eye was fixed on Harriet. “How long, Mrs.
Sanderson, have you known of Mr. Dinneford’s intimacy
with your niece?”</p>

<p>There was a slight but painful pause, and it was broken
by a rather faltering reply.</p>

<p>“It is just a week since I first heard of it, my lady.”</p>

<p>“Just a week! And in the whole of that time you have
not thought well to mention the matter?”</p>

<p>The tone cut like a knife. And the stab it dealt was
so deep that Harriet was unable to answer the question
which propelled it.</p>

<p>“<i>Why didn’t</i> you mention it, Mrs. Sanderson?”</p>

<p>The blood fled suddenly from Harriet’s cheek. She
grew nervous and confused.</p>

<p>“Please answer the question.” There was now a ring
of triumph in the pitiless tone.</p>

<p>“I wished to spare his Grace unpleasantness,” stammered
Harriet.</p>

<p>“Very thoughtful of you, Mrs. Sanderson,” said Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
Wargrave, bitingly. “No doubt his Grace appreciates
your regard for his feelings. But even if that was the
motive, surely it was your duty to report the matter
to Lady Sarah as soon as it came to your knowledge.”</p>

<p>The hesitation of Harriet grew exceedingly painful to
witness.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said at last. Tears suddenly sprang to
her eyes. “I begin to see now that it <i>was</i> my duty. I
wish very much that I <i>had</i> mentioned the matter to
Lady Sarah.”</p>

<p>Both ladies were so fully set on the overthrow of this
serpent that the air of touching, exquisite simpleness
went for nothing. But in any case they would have been
too obtuse to notice it.</p>

<p>“We all wish that.” Lady Wargrave pursued her advantage
pitilessly. “And I am sure I speak for his
Grace as well as for the rest of us.” She trained a
look of malicious triumph upon the perplexed and
frowning face of her brother.</p>

<p>As became a consummate tactician who now had the
affair well in hand, Charlotte gave the Duke a moment to
intervene if he felt inclined to do so. But she well knew,
a kind of instinct told her, that the attack had succeeded
completely. The housekeeper made such a feeble
attempt to parry it, that for the time being her champion
was dumb. Nor was this surprising. In the opinion
of both ladies the sinister charge of collusion had
now been proved to the hilt.</p>

<p>Lady Wargrave having given her brother due opportunity
for a further defense of Mrs. Sanderson, which
he had quite failed to grasp, proceeded coldly and at
leisure to administer the <i>coup de grâce</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“I am afraid, Mrs. Sanderson,” she said, “that in
these circumstances only one course is open to you now.”</p>

<p>She was too adroit, however, to state exactly what
that course was. She was content merely to suggest it.
But Harriet did not need to be told what the particular
alternative was that her ladyship had in mind.</p>

<p>“You wish me to resign my position,” she said, in a
low calm voice. She turned with tears in her eyes
to the eldest daughter of the house. “I beg leave to
give a month’s notice from today, my lady. If you
would like me to go sooner, I will do so at any time you
wish.”</p>

<p>The words and manner showed a consideration wholly
lacking in the measure meted out to herself. There
was so little of pride or of wounded dignity that the
tears were running in a stream down the pale cheeks.
Uppermost in Harriet Sanderson was still a feeling of
profound veneration for those to whom she had dedicated
the best years of her life.</p>

<p class="ph2">IV</p>

<p>The ladies of the Family had won the day. Mrs. Sanderson
was going. It was an occasion for rejoicing.
She had intrigued disgracefully; moreover, it had long
felt that this clever, unscrupulous, plausible woman had
gained a dangerous ascendancy over the head of the
house. But Aunt Charlotte, it seemed, with the tactical
skill for which she was famous, had driven her into a
corner and had forced her to surrender.</p>

<p>In the opinion of Sarah, Mrs. Sanderson had behaved
very well. It was, of course, impossible to trust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
that sort of person; but to give the woman her due, she
had appeared to feel her position acutely; she had promised,
moreover, to undo as far as in her lay the mischief
she had caused. The ladies saw no inconsistency
in that. They had formed a low opinion of Mrs. Sanderson&mdash;for
what reason they didn’t quite know&mdash;but
now that she had received her <i>congée</i> and they were to
have their own way at last there would be no harm in
taking up a magnanimous attitude towards her.</p>

<p>As far as it went this was well enough, but a serious
and solemn task had been imposed upon various people
by the circumstances of the case. It now seemed of
vital importance to those concerned that Jack should
become engaged to Marjorie without further delay.
With that end in view the ladies of the Family were
now working like beavers. But all they had done so
far had not been enough. In vain had the lure been
laid in sight of the bird. In vain had they used the
arts and the subtleties of their sex. For several weeks
now Jack and Marjorie had been thrown together on
every conceivable pretext, yet the only result had been
that the future head of Bridport House had re-affirmed
a fixed intention of taking a wife from the stage.</p>

<p>Three days after Lady Wargrave had gained her signal
triumph over Mrs. Sanderson, the Duke was at home
to an odd visitor. In obedience to the written request
of his Grace’s private secretary, Sergeant Kelly presented
himself about noon at Bridport House.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Joe had been able to arrange for a day
off for the purpose. Thus the dignity of man, also the
dignity of the Metropolitan Force, were upheld by impressive
mufti. He had discarded uniform for his best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
Sunday cutaway, old and rather shining it was true, but
black and braided, with every crease removed by Eliza’s
iron; a pair of light gray trousers, superbly checked; a
white choker tie and a horse-shoe pin; while to crown
all, a massive gold albert, a recent gift from Mary, was
slung across a noble expanse of broadcloth waistcoat.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Sergeant Kelly,” said a musical voice,
as soon as the visitor was announced. The Duke in the
depths of his invalid chair looked at him from under
the brows of a satyr. “Excuse my rising. I’m a bit
below the weather, as you see.”</p>

<p>Joe, secretly prepared for anything in the matter of
his reception, was impressed most favorably by such a
greeting. Somehow the note of cordiality was so exactly
that of one man of the world to another, that Joe was
conscious of a subtle feeling of flattery. He was invited
to sit, and he sat on the extreme verge of a Sheraton
masterpiece, pensively twisting between his hands a
brand-new bowler hat purchased that morning en route
to Bridport House.</p>

<p>“Sergeant Kelly,” said the Duke, speaking with a directness
that Joe admired, “I liked your letter. It was
that of a sensible man.”</p>

<p>“Good of your Grace to say so,” said Joe, a nice mingling
of dignity and deference.</p>

<p>“I agree with you that the matter is extremely
vexatious.”</p>

<p>Joe took a long breath. “It’s haggeravating, sir,”
said he.</p>

<p>“Quite so,” said his Grace, with a whimsical smile.
“But as a matter of curiosity, may I ask what had led
you to that conclusion?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“Just this, sir.” Joe laid the new bowler hat on the
carpet, squared his shoulders and fixed the Duke with his
eye. “The aristocracy’s the aristocracy, the middle-class
is the middle-class, and the lower h’orders are the lower
h’orders&mdash;there they are and you can’t alter ’em. Leastways
that was the opinion of the Marquis.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that I know your friend,” said the Duke
with charming urbanity, “but I’m convinced his views
are sound. If I read your letter aright, you are as
much opposed to the suggested alliance between your
daughter and my kinsman as I am myself.”</p>

<p>“That is so, your Grace. It simply won’t do.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree,” said the Duke, “but from your point
of view&mdash;why won’t it? I ask merely for information.”</p>

<p>“Why won’t it, sir?” said Joe, surprisedly. “Don’t
I say the aristocracy’s the aristocracy?”</p>

<p>“In other words you disapprove of them on principle?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, it’s because I respect ’em so highly,” said
Joe, with a simple largeness that bore no trace of the
sycophant. “I’ve not reggerlated the traffic at Hyde Park
Corner all these years without learning that it won’t
do to keep on mixing things up in the way we’re
doing at present. Things are in a state of flux, as
you might say.”</p>

<p>“Profoundly true,” said the Duke, with a fine appearance
of gravity. “And I have asked you to come here,
Sergeant Kelly, to advise me in a very delicate matter.
In the first place, I assume that you have withheld your
consent to this ridiculous marriage.”</p>

<p>“That is so, your Grace. But the young parties are
that headstrong they may not respect their elders. I
told the young gentleman what my feeling was, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
told the girl, but I’m sorry to say they laughed at me.
Yes, sir, society is in a state of flux and no mistake.”</p>

<p>“Well, Sergeant Kelly, what’s to be done?”</p>

<p>“I should like your Grace to speak a word to the
parties. Seemingly they take no notice of me. But perhaps
they might of you, sir.”</p>

<p>The Duke smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, they only laugh at me,” said Joe. “But
with you it would be different.” And then with admirable
directness: “Why not see the girl and give her
your views in the matter? She’s very sensible and
she’s been well brought up.”</p>

<p>The Duke looked at his visitor steadily. If his Grace
was in search of <i>arrière pensée</i>, he failed to find a sign
of it in that transparently honest countenance.</p>

<p>“A bold suggestion,” he said, with a smile. “But I
don’t know that I have any particular aptitude for handling
headstrong young women.”</p>

<p>Joe promptly rebutted the ducal modesty. “Your
words would carry weight, sir. She’s a girl who knows
what’s what, I give you my word.”</p>

<p>The Duke could hardly keep from laughing outright at
the sublime seriousness of this old bobby. But at the
same time curiosity stirred him. What sort of a girl
was this who owned such a genial grotesque of a father?
It would impinge on the domain of comic opera to instal
such a being as the future châtelaine of Bridport House.
Still, as his visitor shrewdly said, society was in a state
of flux.</p>

<p>“My own belief is,” said Joe, “that she’s the best girl
in England, and if your Grace would set your point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
view before her as you have set it before me, I’m thinking
she’d do her best to help us.”</p>

<p>The Duke was impressed by such candor, such openness,
such simplicity. After all, there was just a chance
that things might take a more hopeful turn.</p>

<p>“She’s not one to go where she’s not wanted, sir,”
said Joe. “And my belief is that if you have a little
talk with her and let her know how you feel about it,
you may be spared a deal o’ trouble.”</p>

<p>“You really think that?” said the Duke with a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>“I do, sir. Leastways, if you ain’t, Joseph Kelly will
be disappointed.”</p>

<p>Such disinterestedness was not exactly flattering, yet
the Duke was touched by it. Indeed, Sergeant Kelly’s
sturdy common sense was so reassuring that he was
invited to have a cigar. At the request of his host, he
pressed the bell, one long and one short, and in the process
of time a servant appeared with a box of Coronas.
Joe chose one, smelt it, placed it to his ear and then
put it sedately in his pocket.</p>

<p>“I’ll not smoke it now, sir,” he said urbanely. “I’ll keep
it until I can really enjoy it.”</p>

<p>He was graciously invited to take several. With an
air of polite deprecation he helped himself to three more.
Then he realized that the time had come to withdraw.</p>

<p>The parting was one of mutual esteem. If the girl
would consent to pay a visit to Bridport House, the Duke
would see her gladly. But again his Grace affirmed that
he was not an optimist. Society <i>was</i> in a state of flux,
he quite agreed, democracy was knocking at the gate
and none knew the next turn in the game. Still the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
Duke was not unmindful of Sergeant Kelly’s remarkable
disinterestedness, and took a cordial leave of him, fully
prepared to follow his advice in this affair of thorns.</p>

<p>As soon as the door had closed upon the dignified form
of Sergeant Kelly, the Duke lay back in his chair fighting
a storm of laughter. Cursed with a sense of humor,
at all times a great handicap for such a one as himself,
its expression had seldom been less opportune or more
uncomfortable. For there was really nothing to laugh
at in a matter of this kind. The thing was too grimly
serious.</p>

<p>Still, for the moment, this amateur of the human comedy
was the victim of a divided mind. He wanted to
laugh until he ached over this solemn policeman upholding
the fabric of society.</p>

<p>“By gad, he’s right,” Albert John ruminated, as he
dipped gout-ridden fingers in his ravished cigar box.
“Things <i>are</i> in a state of flux.” He cut off the end of
a cigar. “My own view is that this monstrous bluff
which these poor fools have allowed some of us to put
up since the Conquest, more or less, will mighty soon
be about our ears. However,”&mdash;Albert John placed
the cigar between his lips&mdash;“it hardly does to say so.”</p>

<p>For a time this was the sum of his reflections. Then
he pressed the bell at his elbow and the servant reappeared.</p>

<p>“Ask Mr. Twalmley to be good enough to telephone
to Mr. Dinneford. I wish to see him at once.”</p>

A TRAGIC COIL</h2></div>

<p class="ph2">I</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ary</span>, breakfasting late and at leisure, before
her ride at eleven, had propped the <i>Morning
Post</i> against the coffee-pot. Milly was arranging
roses in a blue bowl.</p>

<p>“I’m miserable!” Mary suddenly proclaimed. She
had let her eyes stray to the column devoted to marriage
and the giving in marriage, and at last she had flung the
paper away from her.</p>

<p>“Get on with your breakfast,” said the practical Milly.
“I’ve really no patience with you.”</p>

<p>Mary rose from the table with big trouble in her face.</p>

<p>“You’re a gaby,” said Milly, scornfully. “If everybody
was like you there’d be no carrying on the world
at all. You’re absurd. Mother is quite annoyed with
you, and so am I.”</p>

<p>“I’m simply wretched.” The tone was very far from
that of the fine resolute creature whom Milly adored.</p>

<p>The truth was Mary had been following a policy of
drift and it was beginning to tell upon her. Nearly a
week had gone since the visit to Laxton had disclosed a
state of things which had trebly confounded confusion.
Besides, that ill-timed pilgrimage had given duty a sharper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
point, a keener edge, but as yet she had not gathered
the force of will to meet the hard logic of the matter
squarely.</p>

<p>In spite of a growing resolve to make an end of a
situation that all at once had become intolerable, she had
weakly consented to ride that morning with Jack as
usual. So far he had proved the stronger, no doubt
because two factors of supreme importance were on his
side. One was the promise into which very incautiously
she had let herself be lured, to which he had ruthlessly
held her, the other the simple fact that she was deeply
in love with him. It had been very perilous to temporize,
yet having been weak enough to do so, each passing
day tightened her bonds. The little scheme had
failed. Laxton had caused not the slightest change in
his attitude; he was not the kind of man to be influenced
by things of that kind; only a simpleton like herself
would expect him to be! No, the plain truth was he was
set more than ever on not giving her up, and it was going
to be a desperate business to compel him. To make
matters worse his attraction for her was great. There
was a force, a quality about him which she didn’t know
how to resist. When they were apart she made resolves
which when they were together she found herself unable
to keep. The truth was, the cry of nature was too
strong.</p>

<p>Milly looked up from her roses to study a picture of
distraction.</p>

<p>“You odd creature.” A toss of a sagacious head.</p>

<p>The charge was admitted frankly, freely, and fully.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you in the least.” A wrinkling
of a pert nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t understand myself.”</p>

<p>Milly looked at her wonderingly. “I really don’t.
You are quite beyond me. If you were actually afraid
of these people, which I don’t for a moment think you
are, one might begin to see what’s at the back of your
absurd mind.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you think I’m afraid of them?” Mary
in spite of herself was a little amused by the downrightness.</p>

<p>The question brought her right up against an eye
of very honest admiration.</p>

<p>“Because, Miss Lawrence, it simply isn’t in you to be
afraid of anybody.”</p>

<p>Princess Bedalia shook a rueful head. “You say that
because you don’t know all. I’m in a mortal funk of
Bridport House.”</p>

<p>“That I won’t believe,” said the robust Milly. “And
if a fit of high-falutin’ sentiment, for which you’ll get
not an ounce of credit, causes you to throw away your
happiness, and turn your life into a sob-story, neither
my mother nor I will ever forgive you, so there!”</p>

<p>“You seem to forget that I am the housekeeper’s
niece.”</p>

<p>“As though it mattered.” The pert nose twitched
furiously. “As though it matters a row of little apples.
You are yourself&mdash;your big and splendid self. Any man
is lucky to get you.”</p>

<p>But the large, long-lashed eyes were full of pain.
“We look at things so differently. I can’t explain what
I mean or what I feel, but I want to see the whole thing,
if I can, as others see it.”</p>

<p>“We are the others&mdash;mother and I,” said Milly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
stoutly. “But as we are not titled snobs with Bridport
House stamped on our notepaper, I suppose we don’t
count.”</p>

<p>“That’s not fair.” A curious look came into Mary’s
face, which Milly had noticed before and, for a reason
she couldn’t explain, somehow resented. “They have
their point of view and it’s right that they should have.
Without it they wouldn’t be what they are, would they?”</p>

<p>“You speak as if they were better than other people.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course.”</p>

<p>“I shall begin to think you are as bad as they are,”
Milly burst out impatiently. “You are the oddest creature.
I can understand your not going where you are
not wanted, but that’s no reason why you should fight
for the other side.”</p>

<p>“I want them to have fair play.”</p>

<p>“It’s more than they mean you to have, any way.”</p>

<p>“One oughtn’t to say that.” The tone had a quaint
sternness, charming to the ear, yet with a great power
of affront for the soul of Milly.</p>

<p>“Miss Lawrence,” said that democrat, “you annoy me.
If you go on like this before mother she’ll shake you.
The trouble with you”&mdash;a rather fierce recourse to a
cigarette&mdash;“is that you are a bit of a prig. You must
admit that you are a bit of a prig, aren’t you now?”</p>

<p>“More than a bit of one,” sighed Mary. And then
the light of humor broke over her perplexity. In the
eyes of Milly this was her great saving clause; and in
spite of an ever-deepening annoyance with her friend
for the hay she was making of such amazingly brilliant
prospects, she could not help laughing at the comic look
of her now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“You are much too clever to take things so seriously,”
said Milly. “You are not the least bit of a prig in anything
else, and that’s why you made me so angry. Be
sensible and follow your luck. Jack should know far
better than you. Besides, if you didn’t mean to keep
your word, why did you give it?”</p>

<p>This was a facer, as the candid Milly intended it to be.</p>

<p>“Because I was a fool.” At the moment that seemed
the only possible answer.</p>

<p class="ph2">II</p>

<p>The argument had not gone farther when a rather
strident “coo-ee” ascending from the pavement below
found its way through the open window.</p>

<p>“Diana, you are wanted.” The impulsive Milly ran
on to the little balcony to wave a hand of welcome to a
young man in the street.</p>

<p>It was the intention, however, of the young man in the
street, as soon as he could find someone to look after
his horses, to come up and have a talk with Mary. To
the quick-witted person to whom he made known that
resolve, he seemed much graver than usual. It hardly
required any special clairvoyance on the part of Milly to
realize that something was in the wind.</p>

<p>Three minutes later, Jack had found his way up and
Milly had effaced herself discreetly. This morning that
warrior was not quite the serenely humorous self whom
his friends found so engaging. Recent events had annoyed
him, disquieted him, upset him generally, and the
previous afternoon they had culminated in a long and
unsatisfactory interview at Bridport House.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>Those skilled in the signs might have told, from the
young man’s manner, that he had cast himself for a big
thinking part. This morning he was “all out” for diplomacy.
He would like Mary to know that his back was to
the wall, and that he must be able to count on her implicitly
in the stern fight ahead; but the crux of the problem
was, and for that reason he felt such a great need of
cunning, if he let her know the full force and depth of
the opposition the effect upon her might be the reverse
of what he intended. Even apart from the stab to her
pride, she was quite likely to make it a pretext for
further quixotism. Therefore, Mr. John Dinneford had
decided to walk very delicately indeed this morning.</p>

<p>His Grace, it appeared, had asked to see the lady in
the case. Jack, however, scenting peril in the request,
had by no means consented lightly to that. Diplomacy,
assuming a very large D, had promptly assured him that
his kinsman and fiancée were far too much birds of a
feather; their method of looking at large issues was
ominously alike. Mary had developed what Jack called
“the Aunt Sanderson viewpoint” to an alarming degree.
Aunt Sanderson, no doubt, had acquired it in the first
place from the fountain head; its authenticity therefore
made it the more perilous.</p>

<p>“Uncle Albert sends his compliments and hopes you’ll
be kind enough to go and see him.” The statement was
made so casually that it was felt to be a masterpiece of
the non-committal. He would defy anyone to tell from
his tone how he had fought the old wretch, how he had
tried to outwit him, how he had done his damnedest to
short-circuit a most mischievous resolve.</p>

<p>“Now.” The diplomatist took her boldly by a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
fine pair of shoulders, and so made a violent end of the
pause which had followed the important announcement.
“Whatever you do, be careful not to give away the whole
position. There’s a cunning old fox to deal with, and
if he finds the weak spot, we’re done.”</p>

<p>“You mean he thinks as I do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t say he does exactly, but, of course, he may.
When you come to Bridport House, you are up against
all sorts of crassness.”</p>

<p>“Or common sense, whichever you choose to call it,”
said the troubled Mary.</p>

<p>“Don’t you go playing for them.” He shook the fine
shoulders in a masterful colonial manner. “If you do,
I’ll never forgive you. Bridport House can be trusted
to take very good care of itself. We’ve got to keep our
own end going. If we have really made up our minds
to get married, no one has a right to prevent us, and it’s
up to you to let his Grace know that.”</p>

<p>Again came the look of trouble. “But suppose I don’t
happen to think so?”</p>

<p>“I think so for you. In fact, I think it so strongly
that I intend to answer for both.”</p>

<p>She could not help secretly admiring this cool audacity.
At any rate, it was the speech of a man who knew his
own mind, and in spite of herself it pleased her.</p>

<p>“Now, remember.” Once more the over-bold wooer
resorted to physical violence: “You simply can’t afford
to enjoy the luxury of your fine feelings in this scene
of the comedy. As I say, he’s a cunning old fox and
he’ll play on them for all he’s worth.”</p>

<p>“But why should he?”</p>

<p>“Because he knows you are Mrs. Sanderson’s niece.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“In his opinion that would make one the less likely
to have them, wouldn’t it?” She tried very hard to
keep so much as a suspicion of bitterness out of her tone,
yet somehow it seemed almost impossible to do that.</p>

<p>“He’s not exactly a fool. Nobody knows better than
he that your Aunt Sanderson is more royalist than the
king. And my view is that he and she have laid their
heads together in order to work upon your scruples.”</p>

<p>“Pray, why shouldn’t they? Isn’t it right that they
should?”</p>

<p>“There you go!” he said sternly. “Now, look here.”
In the intensity of the moment his face was almost
touching hers. “I’m next in at Bridport House, so this
is my own private funeral. But I just want to say this.
A man can’t go knocking about the world in the way
I have done without getting through to certain things.
And as soon as that happens one no longer sees Bridport
House at the angle at which it sees itself. White marble
and precedence were all very well in the days of Queen
Victoria, but they won’t build airships, you know.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of a duchess building airships.”</p>

<p>“It’s the duke who is going to do the building. The
particular hobo I’m figuring on has got to take a hand in
all sorts of stunts at this moment of the world’s progress
which will make his distinguished forbears turn in their
graves, no doubt. It seems to me he’s got to do a single
on the big time, as they say in vaudeville, and the finest
girl in the western hemisphere must keep him up to his
job.”</p>

<p>“‘Some’ talk,” said Mary, with a smile rather drawn
and constrained.</p>

<p>“You see”&mdash;the force of his candor amused her considerably&mdash;“I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
drawn a big prize in the lottery, and if
I let myself be robbed of it by other people’s tomfool
tricks, I’m a guy, a dead-beat, an out and out dud.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you see,” she urged, laughing a little,
although suffering bitterly, “how cruel it would be for
them, poor souls? We <i>must</i> think of them a little.”</p>

<p>“Why should they come in at all?”</p>

<p>“I really think they ought, poor dears. After all, they
stand for something.” She recalled their former talk on
this vexed subject.</p>

<p>“What do they stand for?&mdash;that’s the point. They
are an inbred lot, a mass of conceit and silly prejudice.
I’m sorry to give them away like this, but, after all, they
are only very distant relations to whom I owe nothing,
and they have a trick of annoying me unspeakably.”</p>

<p>“I won’t have you say such things.” The stern line
of a truly adorable mouth was a delight, a challenge.
“You are one of them, whether you want to be or
whether you don’t, and it’s your duty to stand by them.
<i>Noblesse oblige</i>, you know.”</p>

<p>“And that means a scrupulous respect for the feelings
of other people, if it means anything. No, let us see
things as they are and come down to bedrock.” And as
the Tenderfoot spoke after this manner, he took a hand
of hers in each of his in a fashion at once whimsical,
delicate, and loverlike. Somehow he had the power to
put an enchantment upon her. “You’ve got to marry me
whatever happens.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t ask me to do that.” Black trouble was
now in her eyes. “Don’t ask me to go where I’m not
wanted.”</p>

<p>“Certainly you shan’t. We can do without Bridport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
House, and if they can do without us, by all means
let ’em.”</p>

<p>“But they are in a cleft stick, aren’t they? If you
insist, they will simply have to climb down, and that’s
why it would be cruel to make them. Don’t be too hard
upon them&mdash;<i>please</i>!” A sudden change of voice, rich
and surprising, held him like magic. “Somehow they
don’t quite seem to deserve it. They have their points.
And they are really rather big and fine if you see them
as I do.”</p>

<p>“They are crass, conceited, narrow, ossified. They
think the world was made for ’em, instead of thinking
they were made for the world. It’s time they had a
lesson. And you and I have got to teach ’em.” He
took her wrists and drew her to him. “We’ve got to
larn ’em to be toads&mdash;you and me.”</p>

<p>“On these grounds you command me!” The flash
of glorious eyes was a direct challenge.</p>

<p>“No, on these&mdash;you darling.” And he took her in
his arms and held her in a grip of iron.</p>

<p class="ph2">III</p>

<p>“Please, please!”</p>

<p>Reluctantly he let her go&mdash;provisionally and on
sufferance.</p>

<p>But there was something in her face that looked like
fear. The observant lover saw it at once, and the invincible
lover tried to dispel it.</p>

<p>“Why take it tragically?” he said. “It’s a thing to
laugh at, really.”</p>

<p>She shook a solemn head. “We <i>must</i> think of them&mdash;you
must at any rate. You are all they have, and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
are bound to play for them as well as you know how&mdash;aren’t
you, my dear?” The soft fall of her voice laid
a siren’s spell upon him. His eyes glowed as he looked
at her.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t see it in that way,” he said. “Somehow
I can’t. It’s my colonial outlook, I daresay&mdash;anyhow
there it is&mdash;simply us two. The bedrock of the matter
is you and me? And when you get down to that, other
people don’t come in, do they?”</p>

<p>Again she shook a head rather woeful in its defiance.
“Poor Aunt Harriet came to me yesterday. I wish you
could have seen her. This means the end of the world
for her. She almost went down on her knees to implore
me not to marry you.”</p>

<p>The Tenderfoot snorted with impatience. “That’s
where this old one-horse island gets me all the time.
Things are all wrong here. They’re positively medieval.”</p>

<p>“You forget”&mdash;the tone of the voice was stern dissent&mdash;“she’s
been thirty years a servant in the Family.”</p>

<p>“That should make her all the prouder to see her niece
married to the head of it.” He was determined to stand
his ground.</p>

<p>“Yes, but she understands what it means to them.
She has thought herself into their skins; she lives and
moves and has her being in Bridport House. Dear soul,
it makes me weep to think of her! She almost forced
me to give you up.”</p>

<p>“You can’t do that, not on grounds of that kind.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t I?”</p>

<p>“Because I won’t let you.” She was bound to admire
this masculine decision. “Your Aunt Sanderson is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
woman of fine character and Uncle Albert has a great regard
for her, but why let ourselves be sidetracked by
prejudice? You see this is the call of the blood, and&mdash;under
Providence!&mdash;it means the grafting of a very valuable
new strain upon a pretty effete one. I mean no disrespect
to Bridport House, but look what the system of
intermarriage has done for it. From all one hears poor
Lyme was better out of the world than in it. And that
parcel of stupid women! And, of course, I should never
have been here at all if another couple of consumptive
cousins hadn’t suddenly decided to hand in their checks.
So much for the feudal system, so much for inbreeding
and marrying to order. No, it won’t do!”</p>

<p>In spite of her own deep conviction, she could not
hope to shake such force and such sincerity. She was
bound to admit the strength of his case. But the power
of his argument left her in a miserable dilemma, from
which there seemed but one means of escape. There
must be no half-measures.</p>

<p>“Let us be wise and make an end now,” she said very
softly.</p>

<p>“It’s not playing fair if you do,” was the ruthless
answer. “Besides, as I say, Uncle Albert wants to see
you.”</p>

<p>“I am quite sure it would be far better to end it all
now.”</p>

<p>“You must go and see Uncle Albert before we decide
upon anything,” he said determinedly.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind doing that, if really he wishes it.”
There was a queer little note of reverence in her tone,
which the Tenderfoot, having intelligently anticipated,
was inclined to resent as soon as he heard it. “I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
know why he should trouble himself with me, but I’ll
go as he asks me to. But whatever happens we can’t
possibly get married, unless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Unless what?” he demanded sternly.</p>

<p>“Unless the head of the house gives a full and free
consent, and of course he’ll never do that.”</p>

<p>“It remains to be seen, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it’s all so clear. Poor Aunt Harriet has
made me realize that. I never saw anyone so upset as
she was yesterday; she nearly broke down, poor dear.
She has made me see that there is so much at stake for
them all, that it simply becomes one’s duty not to go on.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish! Rubbish! Rubbish!” The Tenderfoot
suddenly became tempestuous. “Mere parochialism, I
assure you. I’ve been back six months, and every day it
strikes me more and more what a lot we’ve got to learn.
Our so-called social fabric is mainly bunkum. Half the
prejudice in these islands is a mere cloak for damnable
incompetence. Forgive my saying just what is in my
mind, but this flunkeyism of ours&mdash;try to keep the
daggers out of your eyes, my charmer!&mdash;fairly gets one
all the time. In one form or another one’s always up
against it.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t flunkeyism at all.” The air of outrage was
nothing less than adorable.</p>

<p>“Let me finish&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Under protest!” Her face was aglow with the light
of battle.</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly absurd to take a mere pompous stunt
like Bridport House at its own valuation.”</p>

<p>“I won’t have you vulgar&mdash;I won’t allow you to be
vulgar!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“Be it so, Miss Prim&mdash;but I don’t apologize. One’s
uncles, cousins, aunts, they are all alike, whether they
are yours or mine. They simply grovel before material
greatness&mdash;the greatness that comes of money&mdash;that begins
and ends with money.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be rude, sir!” The stamp of a particularly
smart riding boot, and a flash of angry eyes were as
barbs to this fiat.</p>

<p>“They are all so set on things that don’t matter a bit,
that they lose sight altogether of the one thing that is
really important.”</p>

<p>“Pray, what is that?” The eyes held now a lurking,
troubled smile; for him at that moment, their fascination
verged upon the tragic.</p>

<p>Suddenly both the slender wrists were seized by this
forcible thinker. “Why the time spirit, you charmer.
And that just asks one simple question. Do you love
me&mdash;or do you not?”</p>

<p class="ph2">IV</p>

<p>She tried to keep her eyes from his.</p>

<p>“You can’t hide the truth,” he cried triumphantly.
“And if you think I’m going to lose you for the sake of
some stupid piece of prejudice you don’t know what it
means to live five years in God’s own country.”</p>

<p>She seemed to shrink into herself. “Don’t you see the
impossibility of the whole thing?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Frankly, I don’t, or I wouldn’t be such a cad as to
badger you. If you marry me an effete strain is going
to be your debtor. Just look at them&mdash;poor devils!
Look at the two who died untimely. That’s the feudal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
system of marriage working to a logical conclusion.
And if I put it squarely to my kinsman, Albert John,
who is by no means a fool, he’d be the first to admit
it. No, it doesn’t matter what your arguments are, if
you override the call of the blood sooner or later there’s
bound to be big trouble.”</p>

<p>The conviction of the tone, the urgency of the manner
were indeed hard to meet. From the only point of view
that really mattered it was impossible to gainsay him,
and she was far too intelligent to try. Suddenly she
broke away from him and in a wretched state of indecision
and unhappiness flung herself into a chair.</p>

<p>“The whole thing’s as clear as daylight.” Pitilessly
he followed up the advantage he had won. “There’s
really no need to state it. And once more, to come down
to bedrock, far better to make an end of Bridport House
and all that it stands for&mdash;just what it does stand for I
have not been able to make out&mdash;than that it should
perpetuate a race of inbred incompetents who are merely
a fixed charge on the community.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t see&mdash;you don’t see!” The words were
rather feeble, and rather wild, but just then they were
all she could offer. Yet in spite of herself, and in spite
of the half-promise the intensely unhappy Aunt Harriet
had wrung from her on the previous afternoon, the clear-cut
determination of this young man, his force and his
breadth, his absolute conviction were beginning to tell
heavily.</p>

<p>“You are going to Bridport House to have a word
with my kinsman. And if you’re true blue&mdash;and I know
you are that&mdash;you will make him see honest daylight.
And it ought to be easy, because he has only to look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
at you&mdash;the finest thing up to now that has found its
way on to this old planet, in order to realize that he’s
right up against it.”</p>

<p>He knew his own mind and she didn’t know hers.
Such a man was terribly hard to resist.</p>

<p>“He says any morning at twelve. I suggest tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“You insist?” She was struggling helplessly in
meshes of her own weaving.</p>

<p>“I insist. And my last word is that if you let the
old beast down us, as of course he’ll try to do, I go back
to B. C. and remain a single man to the end of my days.
And I’m not out for that, as long as there is half a chance
of something better. So that’s that.” In the style of
the great lover he laid a hand on each shoulder, looked
into the troubled eyes and kissed her. “And now, if
you please, we will witch the world with noble horsemanship.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
A BUSY MORNING</h2></div>

<p class="ph2">I</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> next morning was a busy one for his Grace,
and it also marked a tide in the affairs of Bridport
House. Soon after ten the ball opened with
the inauspicious arrival of Lady Wargrave. The head
of the Family had just unfolded his newspaper and put
on his spectacles when her ladyship was announced.</p>

<p>As the redoubtable Charlotte entered the room, the hard
glitter of her eyes and the forward thrust of a dominant
chin were ominous indeed. Bitter experience made her
brother only too keenly alive to these portents.</p>

<p>Without any beating about the bush she came at once
to the point.</p>

<p>“What’s this I hear, Johnnie? Sarah tells me you
have revoked that woman’s notice.”</p>

<p>“Woman!” temporized his Grace. “What woman?”
The tone was velvet.</p>

<p>She glowered at him.</p>

<p>“There’s only one woman in this household, my
friend.”</p>

<p>The Duke laid down his <i>Times</i> with an air of extremely
well assumed indifference. Were the parish
pump and the minor domesticities all she could find to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
interest her, while all sorts of Radical infamies played
Old Harry with the British Constitution?</p>

<p>Lady Wargrave, however, was well inured to this
familiar gambit.</p>

<p>“Come, Johnnie,” she said tartly, “don’t waste time.
The matter’s too serious. Sarah says you have asked
Mrs. Sanderson to stay on.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have asked her to be good enough to reconsider
her decision,” said his Grace in the slightly forensic
manner of the gilded chamber.</p>

<p>“On what grounds, may one ask?”</p>

<p>“I merely put it to her”&mdash;he now began to choose each
word with a precision that made his sister writhe&mdash;“that
she was indispensable to the general comfort and well-being
of a man as old and gout-ridden as myself.”</p>

<p>“Did you, indeed!”</p>

<p>It was a facer. And yet it might have been foreseen.
Perhaps the ladies had been a little too elated by their
<i>coup de main</i>; or, had they assumed too confidently that
at last they had made an end of a shameless intriguer?</p>

<p>Yes, a facer. Charlotte could have slain her brother.
He had given away the whole position. It was the act
of a traitor. In a voice shaken with anger she proceeded
in no measured terms to tell him what she thought of
him.</p>

<p>His Grace bore the tirade calmly and with fortitude.
He had an instinct for justice&mdash;long a source of inconvenience
to its possessor!&mdash;which now insisted that there
was something to be said for the enemy point of view.
Still he might not have borne its presentment so patiently
had Charlotte not shown her usual cunning. “She did
not speak for herself,” she was careful to assure him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
“but for the sake of the Family as a whole.” The presence
of this woman at Bridport House could no longer
be tolerated.</p>

<p>To this the Duke said little, but he committed himself
to the statement that Mrs. Sanderson was much maligned
and that they all owed a great deal to her devotion.</p>

<p>This was too much for Charlotte. She bubbled over.
“You must be mad!” Her voice was like the croak of
a raven.</p>

<p>“Personally,” rejoined his mellifluous Grace, “I am
particularly grateful that she has consented to stay on.”</p>

<p>“You’re mad, my friend.”</p>

<p>“So are we all.” His Grace folded the <i>Times</i> imperturbably.</p>

<p>Lady Wargrave was defeated. She abruptly decided
to drop the subject. However, she did not quit the room
until one last bolt had been winged at her adversary,
yet in order to propel it she had to impose an iron
restraint on her feelings.</p>

<p>“Before I go”&mdash;she turned as she got to the door&mdash;“there’s
something else I should like to say. Jack’s
mother is in town and is staying with me. Like all the
Parington’s she has plenty of sense. She will welcome
the Marjorie arrangement&mdash;thinks it quite providential&mdash;has
told her son so&mdash;and she looks to you as the head
of the Family to see that it doesn’t miscarry.”</p>

<p>Her brother’s ugly mouth and explosive eyes were not
lost upon Charlotte, but before he could reply she had
made a strategic retirement. Did these futile women expect
him to play the matrimonial agent? The mere suggestion
was infuriating, yet well he knew the extreme
urgency of the matter. The whole situation called for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
great delicacy. A combination of subtle finesse and iron
will was needed if the institution to which he pinned
his faith was not to be shaken to its foundations.</p>

<p class="ph2">II</p>

<p>Lady Wargrave had gone but a few minutes when
Jack arrived at Bridport House. He had to inform his
kinsman that Mary Lawrence would appear at twelve
o’clock.</p>

<p>The Duke was in a vile temper. Charlotte had fretted
it already; moreover, the disease from which he suffered
had undermined it long ago; and at the best of
times the mere sight of this young Colonial, with his wild
ideas, was about as much as he could bear. However,
he was too astute a man and far too well found in the
ways of his world not to be able to mask his feelings on
an occasion of this magnitude. The fellow was a perpetual
source of worry and annoyance, yet so much was
at stake that the Duke, in order to deal with him, summoned
all the bonhomie of a prospective father-in-law.
If anything could have bridged the gulf such tones of
honey must surely have done so.</p>

<p>Jack, however, was in no mood to accept soft speeches,
no matter how flattering to the self-esteem of a raw
Colonial! He was determined to put all to the touch.
These people must learn the limit of their power. And
as it was the Tenderfoot’s habit to leave nothing to
chance he began with the bold but simple declaration that
nothing would induce him to give up the finest girl in
the country. And he hoped when Mary appeared at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
twelve o’clock his kinsman would bear in mind that very
important fact.</p>

<p>Months ago his Grace had begun to despair of the
rôle of the modern Chesterfield. Even since the young
ass had first reported himself at Bridport House, very
sound advice, based on intimate knowledge and first-hand
experience, had been lavished upon him. The best had
been done to correct the republican ideas he had gathered
in the western hemisphere. He lacked nothing in the
way of counsel and precept. But the seed had fallen on
unreceptive soil, nay, on ground singularly barren.
From the first the novice had shown precious little inclination
to heed the fount of wisdom.</p>

<p>The Duke asked the young man to look at the matter
in a common sense way. He would have an extraordinarily
difficult place to fill; therefore, it was his clear
duty to trust those who knew the ropes. The lady of
his choice was a case for experts. Special qualities, inherited
aptitudes were needed in the wife he married!
Surely he must realize that?</p>

<p>The Tenderfoot said bluntly that he did and that Mary
Lawrence had them.</p>

<p>His Grace managed to hold a growing impatience in
check. But the answer of the novice had revealed such a
confusion of ideas that it was hard to treat it seriously.</p>

<p>“Unless a woman has been born to the thing and bred
up in it, how can she hope to be equal to the task?”</p>

<p>“Plenty of ’em are,” said the Tenderfoot. “Anyhow
they seem to make a pretty good bluff at it.”</p>

<p>His Grace shook a somber head.</p>

<p>“You can’t deny that the Upper Crust is always being
recruited from the people underneath.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>“Immensely to the detriment of the Constitution,” said
his Grace forensically.</p>

<p>“It won’t be so in this case,” said the Tenderfoot.
“Any family is devilish lucky that persuades Mary
Lawrence to enter it. She’s a very exceptional girl.
And when you see her, sir, I’m sure you’ll say so.”</p>

<p>“A young woman of ability, no doubt.” The Duke
was growing irritated beyond measure, yet he was determined
to give no hint of his frame of mind. “These&mdash;these
bohemians always are. But if you’ll allow me to
say so, the mere fact that she is ready to undertake
responsibilities of which she can know nothing proves
the nature of her limitations.”</p>

<p>The hit was so palpable that Jack felt bound to counter
it as well as he could. But his eagerness to do so led
him into a tragic blunder. “That’s where you do her an
injustice,” he said, not giving himself time to weigh his
words. “She didn’t know that she might have to be a
duchess when she promised to marry me.”</p>

<p>The folly of such a speech was apparent to the young
man almost before it was uttered. A sudden heightening
of a concentrated gaze made him curse his own
damnable impetuosity. He saw at once that the admission
would be used against him; moreover, an intense
desire that Mary should have fair play led him into
further pitfalls. “The odd thing is,” he said in his
blunderer’s way, “that she happens to see things here at
the angle at which you see them, sir. At least, I always
tell her so.”</p>

<p>His kinsman smiled. “That gives us hope at any
rate.” And he even showed a glint of cheerfulness.</p>

<p>The Tenderfoot had a desire to bite off his tongue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
He felt himself floundering deeper and deeper into a
morass. A sickening sensation crept upon him that he
had put himself at the mercy of this crafty old Jesuit.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, don’t go taking an unfair advantage of
anything I may have told you.” The sheer impotence of
such a speech served only to emphasize his tragic folly.</p>

<p>By now there was a sinister light in the eyes of his
Grace. The unlucky Tenderfoot could hardly stifle a
groan of vexation. Only a born idiot would have taken
pains to put such a weapon in the hands of the enemy!</p>

<p>Overcome by a sudden hopeless anger the young man
rose from his chair and fled the room. His course was
not stayed until he had passed headlong down the white
marble staircase and out of doors into a golden morning
of July. For the next two hours he ranged the Park
grass. It was the only means he had of working off an
irritation and self-disgust that were almost unbearable.</p>

<p class="ph2">III</p>

<p>Youth and inexperience might have put a weapon into
the hand of his Grace, yet when the clock on the
chimneypiece struck twelve he was in a very evil mood.
The task before him was not at all to his taste; and the
more he considered it the less he liked the part he had
now to play.</p>

<p>From various sources he had heard enough of the girl
to stimulate his curiosity. Apart from a lover’s hyperbole,
of which he took no account whatever, impartial
observers, viewing her from afar, had commented upon
her; moreover, there was the extremely piquant nature
of her antecedents. She was a niece of the faithful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
Sanderson, she was also the daughter of a police constable.</p>

<p>The Duke was apt to plume himself that his instinct
for diplomacy amounted to second nature. But, he ruefully
reflected, his powers in this direction were likely
to be tested to the full. His task seemed to bristle with
difficulties. Bridport House was no place for a young
woman of this kind, but it was not going to be an easy
matter to tell her that in just so many words. The best
he had to hope for was that she would prove a person
of common sense.</p>

<p>When at five minutes past the hour Miss Lawrence
was announced, for one reason or another, the Duke was
in a state of inconvenient curiosity. And as if the mere
circumstances of the case did not themselves suffice, a
chain of odd and queer reflections chose to assail his
mind at the very moment of her appearance.</p>

<p>It was terribly inconvenient for his Grace to rise from
his chair, mainly for the reason that one swollen, snowbooted
foot reclined at ease on another. But with an
effort that wrung him with pain he contrived to stand up.</p>

<p>“Please don’t move,” said a voice deep, clear, and
musical, while he was still in the act of rising. “Oh,
don’t&mdash;please!”</p>

<p>But without making any immediate reply the Duke
poised himself as well as he could on one foot, more or
less in the manner of an emu, and bowed rather grimly.
The dignity of the whole proceeding was perhaps slightly
over-emphasized, it was almost as if he intended to
overawe his visitor with the note of the grand seigneur.</p>

<p>Whether this was the case or not the bow was returned;
and slight as it was, it had a dignity that matched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
his own. Also it was touched ever so gently with
humor. A pair of gravely-searching eyes met the
hooded, serious, half-ironical orbs of his Grace.</p>

<p>“Nice of you to come and see an invalid,” he said
slowly, very slowly, with a good deal of manner.</p>

<p>“A great pleasure,” she smiled from the topmost inch
of her remarkable height.</p>

<p>While these brief, and on his part decidedly painful
maneuvers had been going on, the man of the world had
been busily seeking something of which so far he had
not been able to find a trace. In manner and bearing
there was not a flaw.</p>

<p>Already the expert’s eye had been struck by a look of
distinction that was extraordinary. She was undoubtedly
handsome, nay, more than handsome; she had the
subtle look of race which gives to beauty a <i>cachet</i>, a
quality of permanence. Her height was beyond the common,
but every line of the long, slim frame was a thing
of elegance, of molded delicacy. She was perhaps a
shade too thin, but it gave her an indefinable style which
charmed, in spite of himself, this shrewd, instructed observer.
Then her dress and her hat, her neat gloves and
boots, although they were models of reticence, were all
touched by a subtle air of fashion which seemed somehow
to reflect their wearer.</p>

<p>The “Chorus Girl” was in the nature of a surprise.
The Duke indicated a chair, on the edge of which she
perched, straight as a willow, her chin held steadily, her
amused eyes veiled with a becoming gravity. As the
Duke painfully reseated himself he felt a cool scrutiny
upon him. And that very quality of coolness was a
little provocative. In the circumstances of the case it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
had hardly a right to be there. To himself it
was most proper, but in this young woman, a police
constable’s daughter, who earned her living in the theater,
a little embarrassment of some kind would have been
an added grace. If anything however she had more composure
than he; and in spite of the charm and the power
of a personality that was vivid yet clear-cut, he could
not help resenting the fact just a little.</p>

<p>When at last he had slowly resettled himself on his
two chairs he turned eyes of ironical power full upon
her. Yes, she was amazingly handsome, and she reminded
him strangely of a face he had seen. “I wonder
if you know why I have asked you to be so kind
as to come here,” were the first words he spoke. And
he seemed to weigh each one very carefully before he
uttered it.</p>

<p>“I think I do, at least I think I may guess.” The
note of absolute frankness was so much more than he
had a right to look for that it pleased him more than
it need have done.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said, with a gentleness in his voice of
which he was not aware.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’ve been causing a lot of trouble.” The
tone of regret was so perfectly sincere that it threw
him off his guard. He had not expected this, nay, he
had looked for something totally different. The girl was
a lady, no matter what her private circumstances might
be, and with a sudden deep annoyance he felt that it
was going to be supremely difficult to say in just so
many words what he had to say.</p>

<p>To his relief, however, she seemed with the <i>flair</i> of her
sex at once to divine his difficulty. This splendid-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
old man, every inch of whom was grand seigneur, poor
old snowboot included! was already asking mutely for
her help in a situation that she knew he must dislike
intensely. In his odd silence, in the defensive arrogance
of his manner there was appeal to her own fineness.
She could not help feeling an instinctive sympathy with
this old grandee, who at the very outset was finding
himself unequal to the task imposed upon him by the
circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>They entered on a long pause, and it was left to her
to break it.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know when I promised to marry Jack that
he would be the next Duke of Bridport,” she said very
slowly at last.</p>

<p>The simple speech was intended to help him, a fact
of which he was well aware. And with a sense of acute
annoyance he felt a latent chivalry begin to stir him; it
was a chord that she, of all people, had no right to
touch.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you?” he said; and in the grip of this new
emotion it would have been not unpleasant to add
“My dear.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’m much to blame,” she went on, encouraged
by his tone. “I realize that one ought to have
made inquiries.”</p>

<p>He was clearly puzzled. From under heavily knitted
brows his keen eyes peered at her. “But why?” An
instinct for fair play framed the question on her behalf.</p>

<p>A note of pain entered the charming voice. “Oh, one
ought,” she said. “It was one’s duty to know who and
what he was and all about him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>“Forgive me if I don’t altogether agree.” In spite of
himself he was being conquered by this largeness and
magnanimity. So fully was he prepared for something
else that he was now rather at a loss. “In any case,” he
said, “the fault hardly seems to be yours.”</p>

<p>“It is kind of you to say that.” A pair of wide eyes,
long-lashed and luminous, which seemed oddly familiar,
raked him with a wonderful candor. “But I seem to
be giving enormous trouble to others&mdash;trouble it would
have been easy to spare them.”</p>

<p>Again his Grace dissented. Surprise was growing,
along with that other, that even more inconvenient emotion
which was now driving him hard.</p>

<p>“Don’t overlook your own side of the case,” he was
constrained to say.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there’s that&mdash;but one doesn’t like to insist
on it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“The other is so much more important.”</p>

<p>She felt his deep eyes searching hers, but except a
little veiled amusement, they had nothing to conceal.</p>

<p>“I am by no means sure that it is.” To his own
clear annoyance, the fatal instinct for justice began to
take a hand in his overthrow. “As the matter has been
represented to me there is no doubt, if you took it to a
court of law, that you would get substantial damages.”</p>

<p>“As if one could!” She suddenly crimsoned.</p>

<p>“If I have hurt you in any way, I beg your pardon,”
he said at once with a simple humility for which she
honored him. “After all, if you decide not to marry
my relation you give up a position which most people
allow to be exceptional.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;but if one has never aspired to it!”</p>

<p>He grew more puzzled.</p>

<p>“Can you afford to be so fastidious?&mdash;if you don’t
think the question impertinent?”</p>

<p>“I have my living to earn,” she said very simply, “but
of course I don’t want that to enter into the case.”</p>

<p>“Naturally. Of course. Let me put another question&mdash;if
it is not impertinent?” The eyes of the Duke had
now a grave amusement, but they had also something else.
“I suppose you care a good deal for this young man?”</p>

<p>She simply stared at him in a kind of bewilderment.</p>

<p>Such an answer, unexpectedly swift, nobly complete,
seemed to disconcert him a little.</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and without a word you give him up for the
sake of other people?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;if they insist upon it.”</p>

<p>“If they insist upon it!” He shook his head at her
in rather uneasy surprise.</p>

<p>“I have told Jack that I cannot marry him unless he
has your full consent.”</p>

<p>Again the wide gray eyes looked out fearlessly upon
the rather bewildered gentleman. They could hardly
refrain from a smile at his growing perplexity. But there
was something other than perplexity in his tone when
at last he said, “You know of course that I cannot
possibly give it.”</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="illo2"><img src="images/i_198.jpg" width="300" alt="“You give up your young man&mdash;simply because of that?””" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“You give up your young man&mdash;simply because of that?”</p>

<p class="p2">The unhesitating reply seemed to increase his surprise.
This girl was taking him into deeper places than
he had ever been in before. He shook his head at her
in a whimsical fashion which she thought quite charming.
“It hardly does, you know, to be too bright and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>good for human nature’s daily food,” he said with a
softness in his deep voice, which was enchanting.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m very far from being that.” She smiled
and shook her head. “I won’t own that I’m as bad as
all that&mdash;at least I hope I’m not.”</p>

<p>“But if you insist on being so uncommonly self-sacrificing,
you’re in danger, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“One can’t call it self-sacrifice altogether.”</p>

<p>“Afraid of being bored, eh?”</p>

<p>“I could never be bored with Jack,” she said gravely.
“But I don’t see why one should pat oneself on the back
for trying to live up to one’s principles.”</p>

<p>“Principles! May I ask what principles are involved
in a case of this kind?”</p>

<p>“‘Do unto others as you would be done by.’ It’s
rather priggish, I admit, but it’s a splendid motto, if only
one is equal to it. As a rule it is much too much for
me, but in this case I want to do my best to live up
to it.”</p>

<p>“There you go again.” The old man shook an amused
finger at her. “Why it’s altruism, there’s no other word
for it.”</p>

<p>“It’s common sense&mdash;if one is able to think through
to it.”</p>

<p>“And that is why,” he said, with almost the air of a
father, “you give up your young man&mdash;simply because
of that?”</p>

<p>She nodded. But her smile was rather drawn.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Miss Lawrence”&mdash;the curiosity of his Grace
was mounting to a pitch that enabled him to match her
frankness with his own&mdash;“why are you so sure that
you will be unacceptable here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“It stands to reason, I’m afraid. If I lived at Bridport
House and the future head of the Family married
the housekeeper’s niece, I should be bound to look on it as
a perfectly hopeless arrangement.”</p>

<p>He honored this candor. Choosing his words with
great delicacy, he could but pay homage to such clear-sighted
honesty. “I only hope you will not blame us too
much,” he said finally, with an odd change of voice.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you at all. You are as you are. If I
lived here I am sure those would be my feelings.”</p>

<p>The old man was touched by this generosity. Lest he
should overrate it, however, she added quickly with a
flash of pride, “Besides, I should simply hate to go where
I was not wanted.”</p>

<p>Patrician to the bone, he admired that, too. Every
inch of her rang true. Somehow it had become terribly
difficult to treat her in the only way the circumstances
permitted. But no matter what his private feelings, he
must hold them in check.</p>

<p>“Well, I think, Miss Lawrence,” he said, with a return
to the dryness of the man of the world, “you ought
to congratulate yourself that you don’t live here.” But
suddenly his voice trailed off. “You would not be half so
fine as you are”&mdash;after all, he couldn’t conceal that a
deeply-stirred old man was speaking&mdash;“had you been
born and bred in a hot-house.”</p>

<p>She flushed at the unexpected words. Quite suddenly
her eyes brimmed with tears.</p>

<p>“If I have said anything that wounds I humbly apologize,”
he said, with a gentleness that to her was adorable.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! It is only that I had not expected to have
such a compliment paid me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>“Well, it’s a sincere one.” As he looked at her strange
thoughts came into his mind; his voice began to shake
in a queer way. “And it is paid you by an old man
who is not very wise and not very happy.” As he
continued to look at her his voice underwent further
surprising changes. “I wish we could have had you
with us. There is not one of us here fit to tie your shoe-lace,
my dear.”</p>

<p>Such a speech gave pain rather than pleasure.
She saw him a feudal chieftain, the head of a sacred
order. Was it quite fit and proper that he should speak
in that way to the humblest of his vassals? She would
never be able to forget his words, but in that room,
with the spirit of place enfolding her like some exquisite
garment, she could almost have wished that they had not
been uttered.</p>

<p>Suddenly she rose to go. As he regarded her in all
the salient perfection of mind and mansion, it seemed too
bitterly ironical that he should bar the door against her.
Why were they not on their knees thanking heaven for
such a creature!</p>

<p>“You must forgive us, even if Fate is not likely to,”
he said, thinking aloud.</p>

<p>“Please don’t let us look at it in that way,” was the
quick rejoinder. “We all have our places in the world.
And, after all, one ought to remember that it is very
much easier to be Mary Lawrence than to be Duchess
of Bridport.”</p>

<p>The old man shook his head dolefully, and then, in
spite of her earnest prayer that he should stay as he
was, he rose with a great effort to say good-by. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
deeply-lined face was a complex of many emotions as
he did so.</p>

<p>In the very act of taking leave, her eyes, magnetized
by the room itself, strayed round it almost wistfully.
Somehow it meant so much that they hardly knew how
to tear themselves away. Involuntarily the Duke’s eyes
followed hers to a masterpiece among masterpieces on
the farther wall. He could trace all that was in her
mind, and the knowledge seemed to increase his pain
and his perplexity.</p>

<p>“There’s something wonderful in this room,” she said,
half to herself. “Something one can’t put into words.
It’s like nothing else. I suppose it’s a kind of harmony.”</p>

<p>The Duke didn’t speak, but slowly brought back his
eyes to look at her. His favorite room held treasures
of many kinds, yet as he well knew he was wantonly
casting away a gem rarer than any in his collection.
His eyes were upon a noble profile instinct with the
dignity of an old race. Here was artistry surer, even
more exquisite than Corot’s. He could not repress a sigh
of vexation.</p>

<p>Unwilling to part with her, he still detained her even
when she had turned to go. “One moment, Miss Lawrence,”
he said. “Do these things speak to you?” Near
his elbow was a wonderful cabinet of Chinese lacquer
which housed a collection of old French snuffboxes. He
opened it for her inspection, and with a little air of connoisseurship
she gazed at the rarities within.</p>

<p>“They <i>are</i> lovely,” she said eagerly.</p>

<p>“Honor me by choosing one as a token of my gratitude.”</p>

<p>She hesitated to take him at his word, but he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
so much in earnest that it would have seemed unkind to
refuse.</p>

<p>“May I choose any one of them?”</p>

<p>“Please. And I hope you will do me the honor of
choosing the best.”</p>

<p>Put on her mettle she brought instinct rather than
knowledge to bear on a fine collection, and chose a
charming Louis Quinze.</p>

<p>“You have a <i>flair</i>,” said the Duke, laughing. “That
is the one. I am so glad you found it. I should not
like you to have less than the best. Good-by!” Again
he took her hand and his voice had a father’s affection
in it. Then he pressed the bell, opened the door, and
ushered her into the care of a servant with an air of
solicitude which she felt to be quite extraordinary. As
he did so he apologized with a humility that seemed
almost excessive for his inability to accompany her downstairs.</p>

<p class="ph2">IV</p>

<p>As soon as the girl had gone, the Duke returned
painfully to his chair. He was now the prey of very
odd sensations, and they began to crystallize at once into
emotion as deep as any he had ever felt. Something
had happened at this interview which left him now
with a feeling of numb surprise. The entrance of this
girl into that room had brought something into his life,
her going away had taken something out of it. Almost
in the act of meeting a subtle bond had seemed to arise
between them. It was as if each had a sixth sense
in regard to the other. Their minds had marched so
perfectly together that it was hard to realize that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
this was the first time they had met. This rare creature
had touched cords which had long been forgotten,
even had they been known to exist, in the slightly dehumanized
thing he called himself.</p>

<p>Shaken as he had never been in his life, his mind was
held by the thought of her long after she had gone.
Mystified, disconcerted, rather forlorn, a harrowing idea
was beginning to torment him. At last he could bear
it no longer. Rising from his chair with a stifled impatience,
he made his way out of the room leaning heavily
upon his stick. He went along the corridor as far as the
head of the central staircase. Here he stood a long
while in contemplation of a large, rather florid picture
by Lawrence. The subject was a young woman of distinguished
beauty, a portrait of his famous grandmother,
the wife of Bridport’s second duke. Apart from her
appearance, which had been greatly celebrated, she had
had a reputation for wit and charm; her memoirs of the
’Thirties had long taken rank as a classic; and no annals
of the time were complete without the mention of her
name.</p>

<p>The prey of some very unhappy thoughts, the Duke
stood long immersed in the picture before him. The
resemblance he sought to trace had grown so plain that
it provoked a shiver. The line of the cheek, the shape of
the eyes, the curve of the chin, the poise of the head on
the long and slender throat were identical with the living
replica he had just seen.</p>

<p>At last he returned to his room and rang the bell. To
the servant who answered it, he said: “Ask Mrs. Sanderson
to come to me.”</p>

<p>The summons was promptly obeyed. But as Harriet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
came into the room she bore a small tray containing
a wine-glass, a teaspoon, and a bottle of medicine. At
the sight of these the Duke made a grimace like a
petulant child.</p>

<p>“I am sure the new medicine does you a great deal of
good.” The tone was quite maternal in its tenderness.</p>

<p>“You think so?” The words were dubious; all the
same her voice and look seemed to have an odd power
of reassurance.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I think there can be no doubt of it.” She
measured the dose gravely.</p>

<p>“Well, I take your word, I take your word.” And
he drank the bitter draught.</p>

<p>She put back the glass on the tray, but as she was
about to leave the room she was abruptly detained.
“Don’t go,” he said. “Sit and let us talk a little.”</p>

<p>She sat down.</p>

<p>“Did you know,” he said, and the unexpectedness of
the words threw her off her guard, “that I have just
had a visit from&mdash;from your niece?”</p>

<p>“Mary!” She clutched her dress. “Mary&mdash;here!”
A sudden tide of crimson flowed in the startled face.
But the next instant it had grown white. “No, I didn’t
know,” she said. And then, her soul in her eyes, she
waited for his next words.</p>

<p>There was one stifling moment of silence, then he
said: “Of course you know what is in my mind?”</p>

<p>She nodded, not trusting herself to speak.</p>

<p>While he searched his memory silence came again, and
now it had the power to hurt them both. “Haven’t you
always led me to believe,” he said in a voice of curious
intensity, “that she was a nurse in a hospital?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>Harriet did not reply at once. But at last she said,
“Yes, I have always wanted you to think so.”</p>

<p>He looked at her white face, and suddenly checked
the words that rose to his tongue. Whatever those may
have been, there was an immense solicitude in his manner
when he spoke again. “It is not for me,” he said,
“to question anything you may have said, or anything
you may have done.”</p>

<p>“I did everything I could to carry out your wishes.”
Her voice trembled painfully. “And I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t like to tell me,” he said gently.</p>

<p>“Yes. I couldn’t bear to tell you that she had insisted
on choosing the life of all others you would have
the least desired for her.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think that I complain,” he said. “I know
you must have had a good reason. You have always
been very considerate. But it looks as if the stars in
their courses have managed to play a scurvy trick.”</p>

<p>“That they have!” Once more the swift color flowed
over a fine face.</p>

<p>Suddenly she pressed her fingers to her eyelids to
repress the quick tears.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” he said. “The gods have been a little
too much for us, but things might have been worse.”</p>

<p>Tearfully she agreed.</p>

<p>“The other day when I talked with that excellent fellow,
your brother-in-law, it didn’t occur to me who this
girl really was. I don’t think I was ever told that she
had been adopted by your family.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Harriet, very simply.</p>

<p>“Do your friends know the truth of the matter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think they have a suspicion&mdash;not of the real
truth,” she said slowly.</p>

<p>“Has anyone?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul that I know of.”</p>

<p>“The girl herself, is she also in ignorance?”</p>

<p>“She knows, I believe, that she is only the adopted
child of my sister and her husband, but I don’t think
she has gone at all deeply into the matter.”</p>

<p>“Tell me this”&mdash;the mere effort of speech seemed to
cost him infinite pain&mdash;“do you think there is a means
open to anyone of learning the truth at this time of day?”</p>

<p>“My brother-in-law knew from the first that the child
was mine, but I feel sure the real truth can never come
out now.”</p>

<p>Impassive as he was, a shade of evident relief came
into his face. But the look of strain in his eyes deepened
to actual pain as he said, “No doubt we ought to
be glad that it is so. At the same time, I think you’ll
agree, that we have a duty to face which may prove extraordinarily
difficult.”</p>

<p>Harriet did not speak, but suddenly she bent her head
in a quivering assent.</p>

<p>“You see,” he said slowly, “we can no longer burke
the fact that something is due to the girl herself.”</p>

<p>Harriet’s eyes suddenly filled with an intensity of suffering
he could not bear to look at.</p>

<p>“You know the position, of course?” he said gently,
after a pause.</p>

<p>“I know she has promised to marry Mr. Dinneford.”</p>

<p>“But only if I give my consent.”</p>

<p>“I am sure that is right.” A note of relief came into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
her tone. “She has done exactly as one could have
wished.”</p>

<p>“If one could only see the thing as clearly as you do!”
he said with a reluctant shake of the head. “At any rate
let us try to be as just as the circumstances will allow
us to be.”</p>

<p>“Can we hope to do justice and not hurt other people?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that’s impossible, as things are. But for
a moment let us try to consider the whole matter from
her point of view. Perhaps you’ll allow me to say at
once that the course you insisted on taking seems to have
justified itself completely. She is a girl to be proud of;
and she appears to be living a happy and useful life.
One sees now how wise it was not to take half-measures.
She has been allowed to fight her own battle with the
gifts of the good God, and the result does your foresight
the highest credit.”</p>

<p>The judicial words, very simply uttered, brought a
flood of color to the pale cheeks. But listening with
bent head, she did not look up, nor did she say a word
in reply.</p>

<p>“The heroic method has proved to be the right one,
but I think now we have to be careful not to take any unfair
advantage of that fact. It’s a terribly difficult case,
but as far as we can we ought not to overlook what is
due to the girl herself.”</p>

<p>“But the others!” said Harriet with fear in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, a terribly difficult situation.” The Duke sighed.
“But for the moment let us try to see the matter simply
as it affects her. She has been made to suffer a grievous
injustice so that others might benefit. The question is,
must she still be made to sacrifice herself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>Harriet had no answer to give. The long silence which
followed was almost unendurable in its intensity.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said at last, as he looked at her white face.</p>

<p>She shook her head mutely, unable to speak, unable
to meet his eyes. Tears crept again along her eyelids.</p>

<p>“You wish me to decide?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said at last.</p>

<p>He looked at her now with the light of pity in his
face. Not at once did he speak, and when he did it was
with a clear, a too-clear perception of the impotence of
his words.</p>

<p>“The truth is,” he said, “the problem is beyond me.”</p>

AN INTERLUDE</h2></div>

<p class="ph2">I</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s</span> Mary made her way from Bridport House
across the Park, in the direction of Broad Place
and luncheon, it came suddenly upon her that she
was in a state of the most abject misery she had ever
been in. It was a gorgeous midday of July, but the world
had ceased to be habitable. She had come up against
a blank wall. At that moment there was nothing in life
to make it worth while.</p>

<p>In the ordeal she had just passed through a fierce
pride had forbade her to show one glimpse of her real
feelings. She had carried off the whole scene with almost
an air of comedy, for she was determined that
“those people” should not realize what wounds it was
in their power to deal. But Dame Nature, now that
she had the high-mettled creature to herself, was having
something to say to her on the matter. A price was
being exacted for these heroics and for this stoicism.</p>

<p>The Duke had left an impression of fine chivalry
on a perceptive mind, but in spite of that, now they
were no longer face to face, her deepest feeling was an
angry resentment. Life was not playing fair. In the
course of a strenuous three and twenty years she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
rubbed shoulders with all sorts of men and women, but
in spite of an honest catholicity of outlook, she had come
to the conclusion already that there was only one kind
for which she had any real use. It was not a question of
loaves and fishes, or a puerile snobbishness; it was simply
that one of the deepest instincts she had, the sense of the
artist, demanded a setting.</p>

<p>Walking along, blind to everything but the misery of
this reaction, she was suddenly brought up short, thrown
as it were against the world in its concrete reality, by the
knowledge that a pair of eyes was devouring her. Cutting
across her path at an acute angle as he converged
upon her from the direction of Kensington Gardens was
a man wholly absorbed in the occupation of looking at
her. With a start she awoke to the force of his gaze;
her subconscious perception of it was so strong that it
even aroused a tacit hostility.</p>

<p>Who was this large, lean, top-hatted creature striding
towards her in a pair of aggressively checked trousers?
Where had she seen that freckled face, those bold eyes,
those prognathous jaws? As he came on he caught her
gaze and fixed it; but she dropped her eyes at once,
adroitly giving him only the line of her cheek to look
at. Whoever he was, he was not a gentleman!</p>

<p>In the next moment, however, she had begun to realize
that he was outside and beyond any trite symbol of
that kind. He was less a man than a natural force;
moreover, as soon as he had passed her, he stopped
abruptly and turned round to follow her with his eyes.
She did not need to turn round herself to verify her
sense of the act, even had personal dignity not intervened
to prevent her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>She felt annoyed. Again she asked herself who he
could be. When and where had she seen him? And then
a light broke. It may have been the checked trousers, it
may have been the prognathous jaws, but her mind was
suddenly flung back upon that recent visit to Beaconsfield
Villas, and a certain unforgettable scene. This
slightly fantastic figure was no less a person than
Lady Muriel’s fiancé, the new Home Secretary.</p>

<p class="ph2">II</p>

<p>Crossing to Broad Place she could not check a laugh.
Wounded, angry, humiliated by the pressure of a recent
event, there still lurked in her a true appreciation of the
human comedy. What a pill for Bridport House to
have to swallow! It was poetic justice that the pride
which strained at a gnat so harmless as herself should
have to gulp a real live camel in the person of the
Right Honorable Gentleman.</p>

<p>But the laugh, after all, was hollow. Tears of vexation
leaped to her eyes. And they owed more to the
perception of her own inadequacy in this smarting hour
than to the act of Fate. “Wretch that I am!” She was
ready to chasten herself with scorpions as she crossed
the familiar path into Albert Gate.</p>

<p>Within a very few yards were the loyal, warm-hearted
friends of her own orbit. And there, alas! was the rub.
Her own orbit could not satisfy her now. She craved
something that all their kindness, their cheerfulness, their
frank affection could not give. “Just common or garden
snobbishness, my dear, that’s the nature of your complaint,”
whispered a monitor within. “You are no better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
than anyone else when you are invited to call on a duke
in Mount Street.”</p>

<p>That might be true, or it might not, but sore and rebellious
as she was, she was strongly inclined to dispute
the verdict. After all, her feeling went infinitely deeper.
It was futile, however, to analyze it now. This was not
the place nor was there present opportunity. She glanced
at the watch on her wrist. It was one o’clock.</p>

<p>The watch on her wrist was as hostile as everything
else in her little world just now. Even one o’clock had
a sharp sting of its own. “Don’t be late for lunch,”
had been Milly’s parting words. “Charley Cheesewright
is coming. And he’s dying to meet you.”</p>

<p>She managed to navigate the vortex of Knightsbridge
without knowing that she did so; and then, all at once,
she realized that she was within twenty yards of Victoria
Mansions, and that a rather overdressed young man was
a few yards ahead.</p>

<p>With a feeling akin to nausea she pulled up in time
to watch this short, squat figure disappear within the
precincts of Number Five. For a reason she couldn’t explain
she was quite sure that this was none other than
Mr. Charles Cheesewright. She didn’t know him; if a
back view meant anything she had no wish to know
him; certainly she had no desire to make his acquaintance
going up in the lift.</p>

<p>She hung back a discreet three minutes on the pavement
of Broad Place before daring to enter the vestibule
of Number Five, Victoria Mansions. By then the coast
was clear; Mr. Charles Cheesewright, apparently, had
gone up in the Otis elevator. And she stood on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
mat, drawn and tense, a figure of tragedy, waiting for
the Otis elevator to come down again.</p>

<p class="ph2">III</p>

<p>At last the Otis elevator came down and she went
up in it. And then confronted by the door of the flat,
she peered through the glass panel to make sure that
Mr. Charles Cheesewright was not standing the other
side of it; then she opened it with a furtive key, slipped
in, and stole past the half-open door of the tiny drawing-room
through which came the penetrating accents of Mrs.
Wren attuned to the reception of “company.”</p>

<p>Once in her own room her first act was to look in
the glass with a lurking sense of horror; the second was
to decide, which she instantly did, that it would be quite
impossible to meet Mr. Cheesewright, and that she didn’t
need any luncheon.</p>

<p>By the time she had taken off her hat and made herself
a little more presentable, both these decisions had grown
immutable. She could <i>not</i> meet Mr. Cheesewright, she
did <i>not</i> want any luncheon. All she needed was complete
solitude, and perhaps a cigarette. But all too soon was
she ravished of even these modest requirements. Milly
burst suddenly into the room.</p>

<p>“Twenty past one!” she cried reproachfully. “I didn’t
hear you come in. We are waiting for you.”</p>

<p>Mary saw that her plan must be given up. If she
really meant to forgo a meal and the honor of Mr.
Cheesewright’s acquaintance there would have to be a
satisfactory explanation. But what explanation could
she make? Certainly none that would conceal the truth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
And at that moment she wished almost savagely for it to
be concealed. Confronted by a choice of evils she made a
dash at the less.</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry. I’ll be with you in one minute.”</p>

<p>Sheer pride forced her tone to a superhuman lightness,
verging on gayety. But there was a formidable
member of her sex to deal with. In spite of that heroic
note, Milly was not to be taken in; she looked at the
dissembler with eyes that saw a great deal too much.
“I expect you’ve taken a pretty bad toss, my fine lady,”
they seemed to say.</p>

<p>“I’ll be with you in one minute,” repeated Mary, with
burning cheeks and a beating heart. But Milly continued
to stare. Suddenly she laid impulsive hands on her
shoulders and gave her a kiss.</p>

<p>Mary didn’t like kissing. Her friend’s proneness to
the habit always irritated her secretly; this present indulgence
in it brought Mary as near to active dislike as
it would have been possible for her to get.</p>

<p>Milly went back to the drawing-room seething with an
excited curiosity. Before she could make up her mind
to follow Mary stood a long moment in black despair;
and then “biting on the bullet,” as the soldiers say, she
went to join the others.</p>

<p>“Naughty girl!” was the arch reception of Mrs. Wren.
“I’m very cross. Didn’t you promise not to be late?
But if you must call before lunch on dukes in Park Lane
I suppose people like us will have to take the consequences.”</p>

<p>Mary would gladly have given a year’s salary for the
head of Mrs. Wren on a charger, but Milly intervened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
neatly with the presentation of Mr. Cheesewright, in itself
a little masterpiece of quiet humor.</p>

<p>Princess Bedalia’s reception of Mr. Charles Cheesewright
was perhaps the severest test to which her
sterling goodness had been exposed. Every nerve was on
edge. She wanted to slay Mr. Cheesewright, braided
coat, turquoise tie-pin, diamond sleeve links, immaculate
coiffure and all. But for the sake of Milly she dragooned
her feelings to the pitch of bowing quite charmingly.</p>

<p>Luncheon, after all, was not so bad. Mrs. Wren was
frankly at her worst and most tactless; her one idea
was to impress the guest, to let him see that money was
not everything, and that judged by her standards he was
a most ordinary young man. For such a democrat her
table talk was surprisingly full of Debrett. It was all
very lacerating, but Mary continued to play up as well
as she knew how. And by the time the meal was half
over the reward of pure unselfishness came to her in
the shape of a quite unexpected liking for Mr. Charles
Cheesewright.</p>

<p>By all the rules of the game, that is, if mere outward
appearance went for anything, Mr. Cheesewright should
have been insufferable. But at close quarters, with
curried prawns and chablis before him, and a very fine
girl opposite, he was nothing of the kind. Mrs. Wren
had confided to Mary a week ago, “that she was afraid
from what she had heard, that he was not out of the top
drawer.” The statement had been provoked by an odious
comparison with Wrexham, “who,” declared Milly
in her most aboriginal manner, “had, as far as mother
was concerned, simply queered the pitch for everybody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps in the eyes of Mary it was Mr. Cheesewright’s
supreme merit that, in spite of his clothes, he was modestly
content to be his humble self. In every way he
was a very middling young man. But he knew that he
was and, in Mary’s opinion, that somehow saved him
from being something worse. Mrs. Wren was far from
agreeing. His face and form were plebeian, but there
was no reason why he should take them lying down. He
was Eton and Cambridge certainly&mdash;or was it Harrow
and Oxford?&mdash;anyhow an adequate expression of a
sound convention; and it was for that reason no doubt
that all through a particularly trying meal he kept up
his end bravely. In fact, he did so well that he earned
the gratitude of the young woman opposite, although he
was far from suspecting that he had done anything of
the kind.</p>

<p>She had begun by counting the minutes and in looking
ahead to the time when she could retire with her wounds.
But there was a peculiar virtue in the meal; at any rate
it agreed so well with the natural constitution of Mr.
Charles Cheesewright that he was able to relieve the
tension of the little dining-room without knowing it.
He wasn’t brilliant, certainly, but he talked plainly,
sanely, modestly about the things that mattered; the
Brodotsky Venus at the Portman Gallery, the miserable
performance of Harrow, the new play at the Imperial,
the sure defeat of America’s Big Four, Mr. Jarvey’s new
novel, the prospect of the Kaiser lifting the pot at
Cowes, and other matters of international importance, so
that by the time coffee and crême-de-menthe had rounded
up the meal, Mary was inclined to feel sorry that it was
at an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>When a few minutes before three Mr. Cheesewright
went his way&mdash;to have a net at Lord’s Cricket Ground&mdash;the
famous Princess Bedalia felt a pang of regret.
He had played a pretty good innings already, even if he
didn’t seem to know it. And the honest shake of her
hand did its best to tell him so.</p>

<p class="ph2">IV</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Cheesewright had gone, Mary prepared
to go too. But before she could retire Milly and
her mother were at her. Both had a pretty shrewd
suspicion that she had been making a sorry mess of
things at Bridport House. These ladies, however, were
so cunning, that they did not show their hands at once.
To begin with, they exchanged a glance full of meaning,
and then as Mary got up and made for the door,
Mrs. Wren commanded her to sit down again and tell
them what she thought of Charley. That was guile.
She didn’t in the least want to know what anyone
thought of Charley; besides, it would have been quite
possible for Mary to deliver her verdict even as she stood
with the knob of the door in her hand.</p>

<p>“I like him&mdash;<i>immensely</i>!” she said, returning to the
sofa in deference to Mrs. Wren.</p>

<p>Mother and daughter looked at her searchingly, with
eyes that questioned.</p>

<p>“I like him&mdash;immensely!” she repeated.</p>

<p>“He’s not the kind of man,” said Mrs. Wren with an
air of vexation, “I should have written home about when
I was a girl.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with him?” said Milly, bridling. “Why
do you always crab him, mother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“I&mdash;crab him!” Mrs. Wren’s air was the perfection
of injured innocence. “Nothing of the kind. It isn’t
his fault he’s not a blue blood&mdash;and if my lord of
Wrexham’s form is anything to go by, he may be none
the worse for that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, as far as you are concerned
Wrexham’s the fly in the ointment,” said Milly with a
sudden flutter of anger.</p>

<p>Mary would have given much to escape, but to have
fled with thunder and forked lightning in the air would
have been an act of cowardice, not to say treachery.</p>

<p>The truth was Mrs. Wren still had other views for
Milly, but up till now Wrexham had disappointed her.
Moreover, both these clear-headed and extremely practical
ladies were inclined to think he would continue to
do so. For one thing he was under the thumb of his
family, who were as hostile as they could be; again
Wrexham was a bit of a weakling who didn’t quite know
his own mind. Certainly he had a regard for Milly, but
whether it would enable him to wear a martyr’s crown
was very doubtful. Milly, at any rate, had allowed a
second Richmond to enter the field of her affections, in
the shape of Mr. Charles Cheesewright, the sole inheritor
of Cheesewright’s Mixture, a young man of obscure
antecedents but of considerable wealth. So far Mr.
Cheesewright had received small encouragement from
Mrs. Wren, and Milly herself had been very guarded in
her attitude; yet it was as plain as could be that one of
the more expensive of the public schools and one of the
older universities had made a little gentleman of Mr.
Cheesewright. “But,” as Milly said, “the truth was
Wrexham had simply queered the pitch for everybody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>Mary, as the friend of all parties, including Mr.
Cheesewright, who had unexpectedly found favor in her
sight, felt it to be her duty to stay in the room, so that,
if possible, oil might be poured on the troubled waters.
She had sense of acute discomfort, it was true; and it
was not made less by the sure knowledge that the heavy
weapons mother and daughter were using for the benefit
of each other would soon be turned against herself.</p>

<p>There was not long to wait for this prophecy to be
fulfilled. As soon as the ladies had cut off her retreat,
they dropped the academic subject of Mr. Cheesewright
and bluntly demanded to know what was the matter.
It was vain for Mary to try to parry this expected attack.
Her friends, when their feelings were deeply stirred,
indulged in a sledge-hammer style of warfare, against
which any ordinary kind of defense was powerless.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me,” said Mrs. Wren, “that you have let
them bully you into giving him up!”</p>

<p>This was what Milly was wont to call her mother’s
“old Sadler’s Wells touch” with a vengeance. The
victim bit her lip sharply, but she could not prevent the
color from rushing to her cheeks and giving her completely
away.</p>

<p>“Why, of course she has!” cried Milly, looking at
her pitilessly. “I knew she would. I told you, my dear,
she was set on doing something fantastic. And here
have I been telling Charley that one day she would be a
duchess.”</p>

<p>“I call it soppy,” said Mrs. Wren.</p>

<p>“Downright mental flabbiness,” cried Milly. “It’s the
sort of thing a girl would do in the <i>Family Herald</i>.”</p>

<p>Mary quailed before these taunts. Even if her friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
had an unconventional way of expressing themselves, it
did not blind her to the poignant nature of their emotions.
In the tone of mother and daughter was a note
which showed how deeply they were wounded by her
moral weakness&mdash;they could consider it nothing else.
And the bitterness of the attack was the measure of their
devotion. Mrs. Wren could hardly restrain her tongue,
Milly was at the verge of tears. Such a girl as Mary
Lawrence had no right to wreck two lives for a mere
whim.</p>

<p>“You are nothing but a fool,” said Mrs. Wren.
“You’ll never get such a chance again. I’d like to shake
you.”</p>

<p>Mary had no fight left in her. She sat on the sofa
a picture of dismay. For the first time she saw mother
and daughter as they really were, in all their native
crudeness; yet when the worst was said of them they
had a generosity of soul which made them suffer on
her account; and that fact alone seemed to leave her at
their mercy.</p>

<p>“You’ve no right to let them ruin your life and his,”
said Milly pitilessly.</p>

<p>“One simply can’t go where one isn’t wanted,” said
Mary at last with a face of ashes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren took up the phrase, the first the girl had
been able to utter in her own defense, and flung it back.
“Not wanted forsooth! Who are they that they should
pick and choose! A dead charge on the community&mdash;neither
more nor less.”</p>

<p>“No one can’t,” said Mary, tormentedly. “How could
one!”</p>

<p>“Rubbish!” said Mrs. Wren. “You can’t afford to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
so proud. From the way you talk you might be the
Queen of England.”</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. “And it isn’t quite fair
that they should have to put up with me.”</p>

<p>Those unfortunate words were made to recoil upon
her heavily. Both her assailants were frankly amazed
that she should want to look at the matter from the
enemy point of view. To such a mind as Mrs. Wren’s
it could only mean that Bridport House had hypnotized
her with the semblance of place and power.</p>

<p>“I could shake you,” re-affirmed the good lady. “A
girl as first-rate as you are has no right to be a snob.”</p>

<p>Somehow that barb was horrible. Nothing wounds
like the truth.</p>

<p>Strong in the conviction that “she had got her” Mrs.
Wren proceeded. “You set as high a value on these
people as they set on themselves. It’s noodles like you
who keep them up. What use are they anyway, except
to play the fool with honest folk?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right,” said Milly with flashing eyes, as
she took up the parable. “Wrexham’s one of the same
push. His lot simply won’t look at me, yet I consider
myself the equal of anyone. And I should make a very
good countess.”</p>

<p>Mary could only gasp. She was rather overcome by
this naïveté.</p>

<p>“So you would, my dear,” said Mrs. Wren. “And
one of these days you will be a countess&mdash;if you don’t
throw yourself away on Tom, Dick, and Harry in the
meantime.”</p>

<p>Mary was hard set not to break out in a hysterical
laugh. She was in the depths if ever soul was, yet the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
sense of humor is immortal and survives every torment.</p>

<p>Fate, however, had not yet given the last turn to the
screw.</p>

<p class="ph2">V</p>

<p>At this moment the neat parlormaid came into the
room.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dinneford!” she announced.</p>

<p>Jack stood a moment on the threshold to gaze at the
three occupants. He was rather like a sailor who fears
foul weather and has not the courage to read the sky.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve come, young man,” said Mrs. Wren,
getting up to receive him. And she added almost at
once, for it was never her way to beat about the bush,
“We are giving her the finest talking to she has ever had
in her life.”</p>

<p>Jack nearly groaned. The look of the three of them
had told him already that she must have made a fearful
hash of things.</p>

<p>By now the Tenderfoot had risen very high in Mrs.
Wren’s favor. To begin with he would one day be the
indubitable sixth Duke of Bridport&mdash;a handicap, no
doubt, in the sight of some types of democrat, but apparently
not, in the eyes of Mrs. Wren, an insuperable
barrier. Again, she was a pretty shrewd judge of a
man, and this one had passed all his examinations so
far with flying colors. He was absolutely straightforward,
absolutely honorable; moreover, he knew his
own mind&mdash;whereby he had a signal advantage over his
stable companion, who, in spite of great merits, was lacking
in character.</p>

<p>“Yes, we are setting her to rights,” said Milly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
wrinkling a nose of charming pugnacity. The face of
the culprit was tense and rather piteous, but Jack’s
glance at it was perfectly remorseless.</p>

<p>“I knew she would,” he groaned.</p>

<p>“Knew she would what?” demanded Mrs. Wren.</p>

<p>“Let Uncle Albert down her,” was the prompt rejoinder.</p>

<p>“That didn’t want much guessing,” said Milly bitterly.</p>

<p>“Bridport-House-itis! That’s her trouble,” said Mrs.
Wren. “And she seems to have quite a bad form of
the disease. I can’t understand such a girl, I can’t really.
To me she’s unnatural. If I found people ‘coming the
heavy’ over me, I should just set my back to the wall and
say, ‘Very well, my fine friends, I’m now going to let
you see that Jane Wren is every bit as good as you are.’”</p>

<p>“So would any other reasonable being.” And that unpremeditated
speech of the Tenderfoot’s would have
made Mrs. Wren his friend for life, had she not become
so already.</p>

<p>“That’s what I call sensible,” said she. “And there’s
only one thing for you to do now, young man, and that
is to take her straight away and marry her.”</p>

<p>At this point Mary got up from her sofa. But Mrs.
Wren held one great advantage; she had her back to
the door. “You don’t leave this room, my fine lady”&mdash;again
“the old Sadler’s Wells touch,” and Jack and Milly
could not deny that it was rather superb&mdash;“until you
realize that we all think alike in this matter.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” said the Tenderfoot, immensely stimulated
by this powerful backing. “Let us try to see the thing
as it is. This isn’t a case for high falutin’ sentiment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
Bridport House is steeped in crass idiocy; all the more
reason, I say, that we give it no encouragement.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” chimed Mrs. Wren.</p>

<p>“Quite so,” chimed Milly, who was irresistibly reminded
of a recent command performance of “Money.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren shook a histrionic finger at the luckless
Mary, whose eyes were seeking rather wildly a means
of escape. “Don’t speak! Don’t venture to say a
word!” The victim had not shown the least disposition
to do so. “You simply haven’t a leg to stand on, you
know.”</p>

<p>It was a shameful piece of bullying but the victim
bore it stoically. And it did not go on for long.
Neither Mrs. Wren nor Milly was exactly a fool. As
soon as they saw that main force was not likely to help
them, and that more harm than good might be done by
it, they decided to leave the whole matter to Jack. They
had expressed their own point of view very fully, they
knew that he could be trusted to make the most of his
case; besides, when all was said, he was the person best
able to deal with an entirely vexatious affair.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, the astute Milly flung a swift glance at
her mother and got up from her chair. And without
another word on the subject, this pair of conspirators
dramatically withdrew.</p>

<p class="ph2">VI</p>

<p>Such an exit from the scene was far more eloquent
than words. And its immediate effect was to plunge
Jack and Mary with a haste that was hardly decent, into
what both felt was perilously like a final crisis. Its very
nature was of a sort that a finer diplomacy would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
been careful to avoid. But Jack, baffled and angry, was
not in a mood to temporize; besides, that was never his
way.</p>

<p>The fine shades of emotion were not for him, but he
had the perception to feel that if he remained five
minutes longer in that little room the game might be lost
irretrievably. In fact, it seemed to be lost already. The
specter of defeat was hovering round him; nay, it was
embodied in the very atmosphere he breathed.</p>

<p>Knowing the moment to be full of peril, he determined
to force himself to the greatest delicacy of which he was
capable, for this might prove the final throw. The look
in her eyes seemed to tell him that all was lost, but he
would set the thought aside and act as if he were not
aware of it.</p>

<p>A long and very trying pause lent weight to this decision,
and then at last he said in a tone altogether different
from the one he had recently used, “Tell me, why are
you so determined to keep a hardshell like Uncle Albert
on his pedestal?”</p>

<p>The form of the question provoked a wry little smile.
“We poor females are by nature conservative.”</p>

<p>“You are that,” he said. “Take you and me. We’ve
both seen the world. And the world has changed me
altogether, but I should say it hasn’t changed you at all.”</p>

<p>“No; I don’t think it has,” she admitted ruefully, “in
the things that are really important.”</p>

<p>“Six years ago, before I went West, I saw Bridport
House at pretty much the same angle you see it now.
But I suppose if you get lumbering timber, or living by
your wits, or looking for gold in the Yukon, it mighty
soon comes home to you that it is only realities that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
count. And the cold truth is that Bridport House simply
isn’t a reality at all.”</p>

<p>“There I can’t agree with you,” she said with a simple
valor he was bound to admire. “I haven’t seen the
Yukon, but I’ve seen Bridport House and it’s intensely
real to me. Somehow the place is quite wonderful. It
works upon one like a charm.”</p>

<p>“I was a fool to let you go there.”</p>

<p>“But it only confirms my guesses.”</p>

<p>“Why, you are as bad as your Aunt Sanderson,” he
burst out. “And you haven’t her excuse. One can
understand her point of view, although it’s very extreme,
and absurdly overdone, but yours, if you’ll let me say so,
is merely fanciful. Why you should be absolutely the
last person in the world to be hypnotized by mere rank
and pride of place.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that at all.”</p>

<p>“What is it, then?”</p>

<p>“It’s something I can’t explain, a kind of instinct, I
suppose. Please don’t think I’m overawed by vain
shows. But there is such a thing as tradition, at least
there is to me, and every stick and stone of that house
simply glows with it.”</p>

<p>“Mere sentiment!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;I know&mdash;but sentiment’s the thing that rules
the world.”</p>

<p>“Plain, practical common sense rules the world.”</p>

<p>“I mean the only world worth living in.”</p>

<p>He could do nothing with her, and the fact was now
hurting him horribly. A man used to his own way, of
clear vision, and strong will, he could not bear the
thought of being sidetracked or thwarted. Besides, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
reasoning was demonstrably false. He was growing bitterly
annoyed but, after all, such a solicitude for others
only added to her value. Moreover, here was a nature
almost fantastically fine, and for decency’s sake he must
constrain his egotism to respect her scruples.</p>

<p>But the sense of defeat was hard to bear. Since that
morning’s fatal visit to the Mecca of tradition her will
had crystallized. There seemed little hope of shaking it
now.</p>

<p>“Let me ask one question,” he said tensely. “Do you
still care for me?”</p>

<p>Before she could answer the question her breath came
quickly, her color mounted. And then she said in a low
voice, “I do&mdash;I always shall.”</p>

<p>It was no use telling her she was a fool. She was
grotesquely in the wrong, even if she was sublimely in
the right. He would like to have shaken her&mdash;and yet
how dare he sully her with a point of view which was
purely personal?</p>

<p>“I expect that old barbarian is laughing finely in his
sleeve,” he said with a sudden descent to another plane.</p>

<p>“You don’t read him right.” A warm throb of feeling
was in her voice. “He’s quite deep and true&mdash;and kind,
so kind you would hardly believe. When I went there
this morning I felt I was going to hate him, and yet I
find I can’t.”</p>

<p>“You are an idealist,” he said. “And you’ve tuned up
that old cracked file to the pitch of your own sackbut
and psaltery. He’s not fine in any way if you see him
as I do&mdash;but I’m an earthworm, of course. He’s just
a hardshell and an unbeliever, who runs tradition for all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
it’s worth, because that means loaves and fishes for him
and his.”</p>

<p>She countered this speech staunchly; it was not worthy
of him. And yet the tone of reproof was so gentle that
it gave him new courage. Besides, he was a born fighter
and the mere thought of losing such a prize was more
than he could bear.</p>

<p>“You can’t go back on your word,” he burst out with
sudden defiance. “You made a promise that you’re
bound to keep.”</p>

<p>The look in her eyes asked for pity. “Oh! I could
never go there,” she shivered, “among all those hostile
women.”</p>

<p>“We will keep a thousand miles away from them.”</p>

<p>“They have told me I’m not good enough.”</p>

<p>“Like their damned impertinence!” He flushed with
anger.</p>

<p>“But I promised this morning that I wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“You first promised me that you would.”</p>

<p>Again he had her cornered. It was almost the act of
a cad to drive her so hard, but he was an elemental who
had simply to obey the laws of his being. It seemed
madness and damnation to let her go. And yet there
were tears in her eyes which he dare not look at. If he
saw them he was done.</p>

<p>With a kind of savage joy he felt her weaken a little
at the impact of his will. It was a piece of cruelty for
which there was no help, a form of bullying he could
not avoid.</p>

<p>“The best thing we can do,” he said suddenly, “is to
get married at once and then clear off to Canada. Then
we shall be beyond the jurisdiction of Bridport House.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“That old man would never forgive me,” was the
simple reply. “It would make the whole thing quite
hopeless for everybody.”</p>

<p>He checked the words at the tip of his tongue. She
had no right to play for the other side, but there was
something in her bearing which shamed him to silence.
For the first time he was torn; this immolation of self
might be a deeper wisdom; at least he felt thin and
shallow in its presence.</p>

<p>“Won’t you help me?” She laid a hand on his.
Tears were now running down her cheeks.</p>

<p>He caught his breath sharply at the unexpected appeal;
it was like the fixing of a knife. There was no alternative;
he saw at once with fatal clearness that these four
little words cut the ground from under his feet.</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” he said miserably, “if that is how
you really feel about it.”</p>

<p>She bowed her head in the moment’s intensity.
“Thank you,” she said softly.</p>

<p>He could only gasp. Here was the end.</p>

<p>“We must forget each other,” she said stoically.</p>

<p>“Or ask the sun and moon to stand still,” he said. “I
shall never marry anyone else.”</p>

<p>She gave him the honest hand of the good comrade
and he took it to his lips.</p>

<p>“I shall go back to Canada.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you stay and help them?”</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “these stupid people have got on my
nerves. Besides, this city is not big enough to hold us
both just now.”</p>

<p>“I intend to go to Paris and study for the opera.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“No,” he said decisively. “This time next week I shall
be on my way back to Vancouver, unless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Unless&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Unless Bridport House can be made to forget the
Parish Pump in the meantime. And there’s hardly a
chance of that.”</p>

TIME’S REVENGE</h2></div>

<p class="ph2">I</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">H</span>is</span> Grace had had such a very bad night that
he was only just able to reach his morning-room
by the discreet hour of eleven. He was
so exceedingly irritable that even the presence of the
<i>Times</i> on the little table at his elbow was almost too
much for him. And barely had he settled himself in
his chair and put on his spectacles when an acute annoyance
with the nature of things was further increased by
the ill-timed appearance of his private secretary, Mr.
Gilbert Twalmley.</p>

<p>Mr. Twalmley so well understood the art of being
agreeable, that, of itself, his appearance was seldom if
ever unwelcome; had the fact been otherwise it is reasonably
certain that long ago he would have had to seek
some other sphere of usefulness. And even on this sinister
morning Mr. Twalmley was not the head and front
of his own offending; the germ of unpopularity was in
the message that he bore.</p>

<p>“Sir Dugald Maclean has rung up, sir. He would
like to know if you can see him on a matter of urgent
importance.”</p>

<p>“When?” said the Duke sourly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>“He will come round at once.”</p>

<p>The fact was clear that his Grace was not in a mood
to receive anyone just then, least of all Sir Dugald
Maclean, who at any time was far from being <i>persona
gratissima</i> at Bridport House. But after a mental struggle,
which if quite short was rather grim, he allowed
public policy to override his private feelings.</p>

<p>“I suppose I’d better,” he said with something
ominously like a groan of disgust.</p>

<p class="ph2">II</p>

<p>Even when the decision was taken and Mr. Twalmley
had gone to make it known, the Duke was not quite clear
in his mind as to why he should submit to such an ordeal.
Was it really necessary to see this man? Would any
purpose be served by his so doing?</p>

<p>This morning the Duke was in a mood of vacillation,
itself the sequel to a night of physical and mental torment.
Men and events and Nature’s own self were conspiring
against him; the future and the past were alike
in their menace; he could see nothing ahead but a vista
of anxiety.</p>

<p>Waiting for this man whom he disliked so intensely,
he tried at first to fix his mind on the morning’s news,
and failed lamentably. For one thing the paper itself
was a sinister portent of the times. But there were
others, and in the interval of waiting for an unwelcome
visitor his Grace reviewed them gloomily.</p>

<p>Albert John had lived to see dark days. At heart a
time-server and a cynic, his strongest wish had been to
go to the grave in the faith of his fathers. In the beginning
none had realized more clearly than he that dukes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
were not as other men. Born to that convenient dogma,
or at least having imbibed it with the milk of infancy, it
was in the very marrow of his bones. But now, it would
seem, the Time Spirit had overtaken the order to which
he belonged.</p>

<p>Twin portents of that fact had hovered all night round
his pillow. First came the business of Jack and the
lady of his choice, who at close quarters had proved to
be so much more than his Grace had bargained for;
then there was the minor yet entirely vexing complication
of Muriel and her Berserker of a Radical.</p>

<p>Compared with the first gigantic issue, the second was
a mere sideshow, which in a happier hour his Grace
would have treated with sardonic contempt. After all,
did it greatly matter if Muriel had the ill taste to prefer
an obvious political thruster and <i>arriviste</i> to a state of
single blessedness? The heavens were not likely to fall
in either case. The man was a cad and there was no
more to be said, yet even Albert John was not quite able
to maintain the standpoint of High Olympus. Such a
mountebank of a fellow ought not to count, yet when the
best had been said there was something about the brute
which rankled horribly.</p>

<p>Some years before, in a historic speech in the Gilded
Chamber, the Duke had drawn a lurid picture of democracy
knocking at the gate. His words were so
nakedly obvious that in a single morning they awoke to
fame throughout a flattered and delighted island.
Everybody had known for a generation that democracy
was knocking at the gate, but the true art of prophecy as
a going concern is to predict the event the day after it
happens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>His Grace of Bridport, in the course of an admired
speech, left no doubt as to his own feeling in the matter.
He conceived it to be his duty to hold the gate as long
as possible against the mob. But his memorable remarks,
a little touched, no doubt, with the crudity of one
who spoke seldom, gave opportunity for a thruster in
the person of a rising Scots publicist to convulse the
Lower House with his fanciful portrait of the Great
Panjandrum of Bridport House with little round button
on top.</p>

<p>That had happened some years ago. But the
alchemies of time had now prepared a charming comedy
for the initiated. The temerarious Scotsman, moving
from triumph to triumph, had determined to consolidate
his fortunes by marrying the third daughter of the house
of Dinneford.</p>

<p>When Sir Dugald’s decision became known to the
Duke, his amazement took a very caustic turn. He had
never forgiven the fellow for so savagely flaunting him
as a trophy at the end of a pole. “<i>Rien qui blesse comme
la vérité.</i>” It was therefore hard for his Grace to
knuckle down to this adventurer. Besides, had Sir
Dugald’s opinions been other than they were, one of his
kidney must not look for a welcome at Bridport House.</p>

<p>Democracy was knocking at the gate with a vengeance.
Muriel’s affair had shaken the Family to its base. For
some little time past it was known that she was cultivating
breadth. Her coquettings with that dangerous tendency
had affected her diet, her clothes, her reading, as
well as her social and mental outlook. She had formed
quite a habit of emerging from the Times Book Club
with all kinds of highbrows in a strap. She had made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
odd friendships, she had joined queer movements, and
from time to time she regaled very remarkable people
with tea and cake at Bridport House.</p>

<p>To all this there could only be one end. First she
consulted her oculist and changed her glasses, and then
she fell in love. She was the first of the Bridport ladies
to enter that state; thus she was less a portent than a
phenomenon. Sarah, Blanche, and Marjorie gave her
the cold shoulder, and Aunt Charlotte frowned, but there
was no getting over the sinister fact that Breadth had
at last undone her. Sir Dugald had recently been seen
for the first time in one of the smaller and less uncomfortable
drawing-rooms of Bridport House. The Dinneford
ladies seldom read the newspapers, at least the political
part of them, being beyond all things “healthy-minded”
women; therefore they knew little of the facts
of his career. Moreover, they were in happy ignorance
of the attack he had launched three years ago upon their
sire. But it cannot be said of Muriel that she was
equally innocent. Evil communications corrupt good
manners; Breadth had made a recourse to politics inevitable.
And the slight importance she attached to a
certain incident was, to say the least, unfilial.</p>

<p>In the cool, appraising eyes of Sarah, Blanche, and
Marjorie, the bold Sir Dugald was set down already as
a freak of nature. They were not used to that sort of
person at Bridport House. Unfortunately such an attitude
forbade any just perception of the man himself.
His career was still in the making, and in the view of
keen but unsympathetic observers who had followed it
from the start, the hapless Muriel had been marked down
in order that she might advance him in it. Moreover, up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
till now, his ambition had never known defeat, particularly
when inflamed by a worthy object.</p>

<p>According to biographies of the People’s Champion,
portrait on cover, price one shilling net, which flooded
the bookstalls of his adopted country, his life had been a
fine expression of the deep spiritual truth, “God helps
those who help themselves.” His career had been truly
remarkable, yet in the opinion of qualified judges it was
only just beginning. In the person of Sir Dugald
Maclean, Democracy was knocking at the gate with a
vengeance. Its keepers must be up and doing lest Demos
ravish the citadel within and get clear away with the
pictures, the heirlooms and the gold plate.</p>

<p>“She must be out of her mind,” declared the Duke at
the first announcement of the grisly tidings. Lady
Wargrave went further. “She is out of her mind,”
trumpeted the sage of Hill Street.</p>

<p>There were alarums and excursions, there was a pretty
todo. But Muriel had grown so Broad that she treated
the matter very lightly. The ruthless Sir Dugald had
tied her to the wheel of his car; he was now determined
to lead her to the altar with or without the sanction of
his Grace.</p>

<p class="ph2">III</p>

<p>All too soon for the Duke’s liking in this hour of fate,
Sir Dugald arrived for his interview. At any time he
was a bitter pill for his Grace to swallow; just now, in
the light of present circumstances, it called for the virtue
of a stoic to receive him at all.</p>

<p>Now these adversaries met again certain ugly memories
were in their minds. But the advantage was with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
the younger man who could afford to be secretly amused
by the business in hand. A semblance of respect, to be
sure, was in his bearing, but that was no more than
homage paid by worldly wisdom to the spirit of place.
Right at the back lay the mind of the cool calculator,
which in certain aspects had an insight almost devilish
into the heart of material man. Well he knew the hostility
of this peevish, brooding invalid. He was in a
position to flout it; yet, after all, the man who now received
him would have been rather more than human
had he not hated him like poison.</p>

<p>Sir Dugald could afford to smile at this figure of
impotence; yet the Duke, in his way, was no mean adversary.
Up to a point his mind was extremely vigorous.
The will to prevail against encroachment on the privileges
of his class was still strong. Besides physical suffering
had not yet bereft him of a maliciously nice
appreciation of the human comedy. It may even have
been that which now enabled him to receive “the
thruster.”</p>

<p>As Sir Dugald entered the room he was keenly aware
that the eyes of a satyr were fixed upon him. And the
picture of a rather fantastic helplessness, propped in its
chair, was not without its pathos. The old lion, stricken
sore, would have given much to rend the intruder, but
he was in the grip of Fate.</p>

<p>The success of Sir Dugald had been magical, but luck
had played no part in it, beyond the period of the world’s
history and the particular corner of the globe in which
he happened to be born. He had got as far as he had in
a time comparatively short for the simple reason that he
was a man of quite unusual powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>No man could have had a truer perception of the conditions
among which he had been cast than Dugald
Maclean, no man could have had a stronger grasp of
certain forces, or of the alchemy transmuting them into
things undreamt of; no man could have had a bolder
outlook upon the whole amazing phantasmagoria evolved
by the cosmic dust out of the wonders within itself. The
Duke had the cynicism of the materialist; the man who
faced him now had the vision of him who sees too much.</p>

<p>The Duke, with a great air and a courtesy which was
second nature, begged his visitor to forgive his being as
he was.</p>

<p>Sir Dugald, with a mechanical formula and a mechanical
smile, responded with a ready sympathy. But while
their conventional phrases flowed, each marked the other
narrowly, like a pair of strange brigands colloguing for
the first time on the side of a mountain. It was as if
each knew the other for a devil of a fellow, yet not quite
such a devil of a fellow as he judges himself to be.</p>

<p>Efficiency was the watchword of Maclean. There was
no beating about the bush. He knew what he wanted
and had come to see that he got it. In a cool, aloof,
rather detached way he lost no time in putting forward
the demand he had made at a former meeting.</p>

<p>“But one has been led to infer from your speeches,”
said the Duke, bluntly, “and the facts of your career, that
you stand for an order of things very different from
those obtaining here.”</p>

<p>“Up to a point, yes,” was the ready answer. “But
only up to a point. In order to govern efficiently it is
wise to aim at a centralization of power. The happiest
communities are those in which power is in the hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
of the few. Now there is much in the social hierarchy,
even as at present constituted, which deserves to survive
the shock of battle that will soon be upon us. It ought
to survive, for it has proved its worth. And in identifying
myself with it I shall be glad when the time comes
to help your people here if only you will help me now.”</p>

<p>“In a word, you are ready to throw over your friends,”
said the Duke with a narrowing eye.</p>

<p>“By no means! I have not the least intention of
doing that.”</p>

<p>His Grace was hard to convince; besides the man’s
nonchalance incensed him. “Well, as I have told you
already, the only terms on which we can begin to think
of having you here are that you quit your present stable.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you take a parochial view?” The
considered coolness had the power to infuriate. “Whichever
stable one happens to occupy at the moment is not
very material. It is simply a means to an end.”</p>

<p>“To what end?”</p>

<p>“The better government of the country&mdash;of the Empire,
if you prefer it.”</p>

<p>“You aim at the top?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly. And I think I shall get there.”</p>

<p>The note of self-confidence was a little too much for
his Grace. He shot out an ugly lower lip and plucked
savagely at the small tuft of hair upon it. “That remains
to be seen, my friend.” And he added in a tone of ice,
“When you have got there you can come and ask me
again.”</p>

<p>“But it is going to take time,” Sir Dugald spoke lightly
and readily, not deigning to accept the challenge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
“Meanwhile Lady Muriel and I would like to get married.”</p>

<p>It seemed, however, that the Duke had made up his
mind in the matter quite definitely. There must be a coat
of political whitewash for a dirty dog before he could
hope to receive any kind of official sanction as a son-in-law.
Such in effect was the last word of his Grace;
and it was delivered with a point that was meant to
lacerate.</p>

<p>It did not fail of its effect. Somehow the ducal brand
of cynicism was edged like a razor, and the underlying
contempt poisoned the wounds it dealt. The man who
had sprung from the people, who in accordance with
the brutal innuendo of the man of privilege would be
only too ready to throw them over as soon as they had
served his turn, was powerless before it. At this
moment, as he was ruefully discovering, place and power
did not hesitate to use loaded dice.</p>

<p>Sir Dugald was savagely angry. In spite of an iron
self-control, the cold insolence of one who made no secret
of the fact that he regarded the man before him as other
clay was hard to bear. A career of success, consistent
and amazing, had given Sir Dugald a pretty arrogance of
his own. And he was a very determined man playing
for victory.</p>

<p class="ph2">IV</p>

<p>It was clear from the Duke’s manner that as far as
he was concerned the interview was at an end. But Sir
Dugald had made up his mind to carry the matter a step
farther. He was a bold man, his position was stronger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
than his Grace had reason to guess, moreover, a powerful
will had been reënforced by a growing animosity.</p>

<p>“Before I go,” said Sir Dugald, “there is one last word,
and to me it seems of great importance.”</p>

<p>The Duke sat silent, a stony eye fixed upon his visitor.</p>

<p>“First, let me say as one man of the world to another,
that your objection to my marrying Lady Muriel is injudicious.”</p>

<p>“No doubt&mdash;from your point of view. But we won’t
go into that.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I think we had better. As I say,
it is injudicious. We have fully made up our minds to
marry. You can’t hinder us, you know&mdash;so why make
things uncomfortable?”</p>

<p>“Because I dislike it, sir&mdash;I dislike it intensely!” His
Grace was suddenly overwhelmed by his feelings.</p>

<p>“Do you mind stating the grounds of your objection?”</p>

<p>“It would be tedious to enumerate them.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d like you to realize the advantages of letting
things go on as they are.”</p>

<p>“There are none so far as one can see at the moment.”</p>

<p>“We are coming to them now,” said Sir Dugald
blandly. “In the first place, has it occurred to you that
I may know the history of Mr. Dinneford’s fiancée?”</p>

<p>The Duke stared fixedly at the man before him.
“What do you mean?” he said.</p>

<p>“Suppose one happens to know her secret?”</p>

<p>“Her secret!”</p>

<p>“Her origin and early history.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Is there really any need to ask the question?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>The Duke shook his head perplexedly. “I’m afraid
I don’t follow you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sir Dugald coolly, “it happens that you
are the one man in the world who is in a position to
answer the question I have ventured to ask.”</p>

<p>They looked at each other. A rather deadly silence
followed.</p>

<p>“The question you have ventured to ask.” The Duke
repeated the words slowly, but with a reluctance and a
venom he could not conceal.</p>

<p>“You know perfectly well what I mean.” The tone,
direct and cool, was exasperating.</p>

<p>“Are you trying to blackmail me?” There was an
ugly light in the Duke’s eyes.</p>

<p>Sir Dugald laughed. “Why put the matter so
crudely?” he said. “I am merely anxious that justice
should be done. You ought to be grateful to Providence
for giving you this opportunity.”</p>

<p>“Opportunity?”</p>

<p>“To right the wrong that has been committed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“I refer to Miss Lawrence’s parentage.”</p>

<p>“One fails to see that her parentage is any business of
yours or mine.”</p>

<p>“It is certainly business of yours,” was the sardonic
answer; “and it is going to be mine because I am determined
that matters shall take their present course.
Lady Muriel and I intend to marry, and Mr. Dinneford
and Miss Lawrence ought to marry.”</p>

<p>The Duke gazed at him with an air of blank stupefaction.</p>

<p>“I invite you to give the matter very careful consideration.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
Sir Dugald had constrained a harsh accent to
the point of mellowness. “Let me say at once that if
you don’t withdraw your opposition it is in my power
to make myself rather unpleasant.”</p>

<p>“Nature has relieved you of any obligation in that
matter. You are the most unpleasant man I have ever
had to do with.”</p>

<p>“Let me outline the position.” The mellifluous note
spurred his Grace to fury. “Mr. Dinneford and Miss
Lawrence, Lady Muriel and I are determined to marry
and we must have your consent.”</p>

<p>“And if I don’t give it?” The tone matched the truculent
eyes.</p>

<p>“I may be tempted to use my knowledge in a way
which will be much more disagreeable than the things
you wish to prevent.”</p>

<p>“Do I understand this to be a threat?”</p>

<p>Sir Dugald smiled darkly.</p>

<p>“Very well!” Defiance and resentment rode the Duke
very hard. “Use your knowledge as you like. You are
a scoundrel.”</p>

<p>“A hard name.” Again the Duke was met by a saturnine
Scottish smile. “But my motives are sound.”</p>

<p>“So are mine.” The Duke’s voice shook with fury.
“If you are not careful I will have you put out of the
house.”</p>

<p>“We are not living in the Middle Ages, you know.”</p>

<p>“More’s the pity. I’d have found a short way with
you then, my friend. Your wanting to marry Muriel
is bad enough, your interference with Dinneford is an
outrage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>“In the circumstances I feel it to be my duty to do
what I can in an exceedingly delicate matter.”</p>

<p>“Self-interest, sir, that’s all your duty amounts to.”
But the Duke was now thoroughly alarmed, and he saw
that recrimination was not going to help him. “Tell
me,” he said in a tone more conciliatory than he had yet
used, “exactly on what ground you are standing?”</p>

<p>“In the first place, there is a very remarkable family
likeness.”</p>

<p>“And you base your allegation upon a mere conjecture
of that kind!” said the Duke scornfully.</p>

<p>“Upon far more than that, believe me. I have very
strong and direct evidence which at the present moment
I prefer not to disclose.”</p>

<p>The Duke paused at this bold statement. He turned
a basilisk’s eye upon his adversary, but Sir Dugald
offered a mask, behind which, as his Grace well knew,
lurked unlimited depth and cunning. One thing was
clear: a man of this kidney was not likely to venture
such a <i>coup</i> without having carefully weighed his resources.
In any case there cannot be smoke unless there
is fire. A certain amount of knowledge must be in the
possession of Maclean; the question was how much, and
what use was he prepared to make of it?</p>

<p>“Do I understand,” said the Duke after a moment of
deep thought, “that you have spoken of this matter to
Mr. Dinneford?”</p>

<p>“I have not yet done so.”</p>

<p>“Or to Miss Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;nor to Mrs. Sanderson.”</p>

<p>The Duke’s look of concentration at the mention of
that name was not lost upon Sir Dugald. It had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
effect of hardening the ironical smile which for some
little time now had hung round his lips.</p>

<p>“May I ask you,” said the Duke with the air of a man
pretty badly hipped, “not to speak of this matter to anyone
until there has been an opportunity for further discussion?”</p>

<p>The abrupt change in the tone confessed a moral weakness
which Sir Dugald was quick to notice. But he fell
in with the suggestion, with a show of ready magnanimity
for which the Duke could have slain him. There was
no wish to cause avoidable unpleasantness. Sir Dugald
was good enough to say that it was in the interests of
all parties that the skeleton should be kept in the cupboard.
The matter was bound to give pain to a number
of innocent people, and if the Duke, even at the eleventh
hour, would be reasonable he might depend upon it that
Sir Dugald Maclean would be only too happy to follow
his example.</p>

<p class="ph2">V</p>

<p>Upon the retirement of the unwelcome visitor, the
Duke gave himself up to a state of irritation verging on
fury. Unprepared for this new turn of the game, taken
at a complete disadvantage by a man of few scruples
and diabolical cleverness, he was now horribly smitten by
a sense of having said things he ought not to have said.
On one point he was clear. In the shock of the unforeseen
he had yielded far too much to the impact of a
scoundrel.</p>

<p>The position seen as a whole was one of very grave
difficulty, and the instinct now dominating his mind was
to seek a port against a storm which threatened at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
moment to burst upon him. It was of vital importance
that certain facts should be kept from certain people;
otherwise there could be little doubt that the private
cosmos of Albert John, fifth Duke of Bridport, would
fall about his ears.</p>

<p>Alone with his fluttered thoughts, the Duke spent a
bad half-hour trying to marshal them in battle array.
Face to face with a situation dangerous, disagreeable,
unforeseen, it would call for much tactical skill to fend
off disaster. Never in his life had he found it so hard
to choose a line of action. At last, the prey of doubt,
he rang for Harriet Sanderson.</p>

<p>She came to him at once and he told her promptly of
Sir Dugald’s visit. And then, his eyes on her face, he
went on to tell her there was reason to fear that a secret
had been penetrated which he had always been led to
believe was known only to her and to himself.</p>

<p>Watching her narrowly while he spoke he saw his
words go home. She stood a picture of dismay.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the man really can know all?” he said
finally.</p>

<p>At first she made no attempt to answer the question;
but after a while, in a low, rather frightened voice, she
said, “I don’t think he can know possibly.”</p>

<p>He searched her troubled eyes, almost as if he doubted.
“Perhaps you will tell me this.” He spoke in a tone of
growing anxiety. “Would you say there is anything like
a marked family resemblance?”</p>

<p>“A very strong one, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“It is confined, I hope, to the picture at the top of the
stairs?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no&mdash;at least to my mind&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“She has her father’s eyes.”</p>

<p>“Very interesting to know that.” The Duke laughed,
but it was a curious note in which there was not a grain
of mirth. “Yet, even assuming that to be the case, it
would take a bold man to jump to such a conclusion.
Surely he would need better ground to go upon.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say he has much more than a mere
likeness to help him.” As Harriet spoke the bright color
ran from neck to brow. “He happened to be at my
brother-in-law’s on the evening the child was first
brought to the house.”</p>

<p>That simple fact was far more than the Duke had
bargained for. A look of dismay came upon him, he
shook an ominous head. “It throws a new light on the
matter,” he said, after a pause, painful in its intensity.
“Now tell me this&mdash;did he see the child?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!”</p>

<p>“That helps him to put two and two together at any
rate.” A look of tragic concern came into his face.
“What an amazing world!”</p>

<p>She agreed that the world was amazing. And in spite
of the strange unhappiness in her eyes she could not help
smiling a little as a surge of memories came upon her.
She sighed softly, even tenderly as she made the confession.
“To my mind, Sir Dugald Maclean is one of the
most amazing men in it.”</p>

<p>“Have you any particular reason for saying that?”&mdash;The
gaze was disconcerting in its keenness&mdash;“apart, I
mean, from the mere obvious facts of his career?”</p>

<p>“It is simply that I have watched him rise,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
Harriet, between a smile and a sigh. “When I knew
him first he was a London policeman.”</p>

<p>“How in the world did he persuade Scotland Yard to
part with him?” scoffed his Grace. “One would have
thought such a fellow would have been worth his weight
in gold.”</p>

<p>She could not repress a laugh which to herself seemed
to verge on irreverence. “My brother-in-law says he
soon convinced them he was far too ambitious for the
Metropolitan Police Force.”</p>

<p>“I should say so!”</p>

<p>“And then he studied the law and got into parliament.”</p>

<p>“And made his fortune by backing a downtrodden
people against a vile aristocracy.” The Duke’s smile was
so sour that it became a grimace. “In other words a
self-made man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;entirely!” The sudden generous warmth
of admiration in Harriet’s tone surprised the Duke.
“When one considers the enormous odds against him and
what he has been able to do at the age of forty-two,
it seems only right to think of him as wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Personally,” said his Grace, “I prefer to regard him
as an unscrupulous scoundrel.”</p>

<p>Harriet dissented with a smile. “A great man,” she
said softly.</p>

<p>“Let us leave it at a very dangerous man. He is a
real menace, not only to us, but to the country. Anyhow,
we have now to see that he doesn’t bring down the
house about our ears.”</p>

<p>There was something in the tone that swept the color
from Harriet’s face. “That I realize.” Her voice
trembled painfully. “Oh, I do hope he has not mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
the matter to Mary.” And she plucked at her
dress in sudden alarm.</p>

<p>“Not yet, I think,” said the Duke venomously. “He
is too sure a hand to spring his mine before the time
is ripe. Meanwhile we are forearmed; let us take every
precaution against him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we must!” Her eyes were tragic.</p>

<p>“A devilish mischance,” said the Duke slowly, “a devilish
mischance that he, of all men, has been able to hit
the trail.”</p>

<p class="ph2">VI</p>

<p>When Harriet had gone from the room, the Duke
surrendered again to his thoughts. By now they were
almost intolerable. Pulled this way and that by a conflict
of emotion that was cruel, he was brought more than
once to the verge of a decision he had not the courage to
make. The situation was forcing it upon him, yet so
much was involved, so much was at stake that a weak
man at bottom, he was ready to grasp at anything which
held a slender hope of putting off the evil day. Two
interests were vitally opposed; he sought to do justice to
both, yet as far as he could see at the moment, any
reconciliation between them was impossible.</p>

<p>He was in a state of bitter, ever-growing embarrassment,
when Jack was unexpectedly announced.</p>

<p>His Grace was not able to detach himself sufficiently
from the maelstrom within to observe the hue of resolution
in the bearing of a rather unwelcome visitor.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir,” said the young man coolly, with
an aloofness that came near to sarcasm. And then in
a tone of very simple matter of fact, he said, “I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
merely called to ask if you will give a formal consent to
my marrying Mary Lawrence.”</p>

<p>From the particular way in which the question was
put it was easy to deduce an ultimatum. But it came at
an unlucky moment. So delicately was the Duke poised
between two contending forces, that a point-blank demand
was quite enough to turn the scale. His Grace
replied at once that he was not in a position to give
consent.</p>

<p>Jack was prepared for a refusal. The nature of the
case had made it seem inevitable. But there and then
he issued a ukase. His kinsman should have a week in
which to think over the matter. And if in that time the
Duke did not change his mind he would return to Canada.</p>

<p>The threat was taken very coolly, but his Grace was
far more concerned by it than he allowed Jack to see.
In fact, he was very much annoyed. Here was an end
to the plan which had been formed for the general
welfare of Bridport House. Such conduct was inconsiderate,
tiresome, irrational. But it was not merely the
inconvenience it was bound to cause which was so
troublesome. There was still the other aspect of the
case. He could not rid himself of the feeling that a
cruel injustice was being done to an innocent and defenseless
person, and that the whole blame of it must lie
at his own door.</p>

<p>He had been given a week in which to think the matter
over, in which to examine it in all its bearings. Just
now he was not in a mood to urge the least objection to
Jack’s departure; all the same one frankly an autocrat
resented it deeply. Let the fellow go and be damned to
him! But in spite of the philosophic air with which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
sent the young fool about his business, his Grace realized
as soon as he was alone that it was quite impossible to
shut his eyes to certain facts. Vital issues were involved
and it was no use shirking them. Even if he had now
made up his mind to steel his heart against gross and
rather brutal injustice, so that the common weal might
prosper, nothing could alter the human aspect of a matter
that galled him bitterly.</p>

A BOMB</h2></div>

<p class="ph2">I</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> is a bad business, no doubt, when a statesman
stoops to sentiment. Unluckily for the Duke, now
that a brain cool and clear was needed in a critical
hour, it had become miserably overclouded by a sense of
chivalry. It was very inconvenient. Never in his life
had he found a decision so hard to reach, and even when
it had been arrived at he could not dismiss the girl from
his mind. She had impressed him in such a remarkable
way that it was impossible to forget her.</p>

<p>Beyond all things a man of the world, one fact stood
out with exemplary clearness. If this girl could have
been taken upon her merits she would have been an
almost ideal mate for the heir to Bridport House. She
had shown such a delicate regard for his welfare, so right
had been her feeling in the whole affair, that, even apart
from mere justice, it seemed wrong to exclude her from
a circle she could not fail to grace. In the matter of
Bridport House her instinct was so divinely right that
no girl in the land was more naturally fitted to help a
tiro through his novitiate.</p>

<p>A sad coil truly! And Jack had gone but a very few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
minutes, when the matter took another and wholly unexpected
turn. The prelude to a historic incident was the
appearance of Sarah on the scene.</p>

<p>The eldest flower, the light of battle in her gray eyes,
was plainly bent on mischief. So much was clear as
soon as she came into the room. She had not been able
to forgive her father for revoking Mrs. Sanderson’s
notice. It had been a wanton dashing of the cup from
lips but little used to victory; and the act had served
to embitter a situation which by now was almost unbearable.</p>

<p>Sarah had come of fell purpose, but before playing her
great <i>coup</i>, she opened lightly in the manner of a skirmisher.
Muriel, it seemed, was the topic that had brought
her there; at any rate, it was the topic on which she
began, masking with some astuteness the one so much
more sinister that lay behind.</p>

<p>“Father, I suppose you know that Muriel has quite
made up her mind to get married?”</p>

<p>“So I gather.” Detachment could hardly have been
carried farther.</p>

<p>“Such a pity,” Sarah lightly pursued, “but I’m afraid
there’s nothing to be done. She was always obstinate.”</p>

<p>“Always a fool,” muttered his Grace.</p>

<p>“I’ve been discussing the matter with Aunt Charlotte.”</p>

<p>The Duke nodded, but his portentous eyes asked Sarah
not to claim one moment more of his time than the circumstances
rendered absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>“Aunt Charlotte feels very strongly that it will be wise
for you to give your consent.”</p>

<p>“Why?” The Duke yawned, but the look in his face
was not of the kind that goes with mere boredom. “Any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
specific ground for the suggestion?” He scanned Sarah
narrowly, with heavily-lidded eyes.</p>

<p>“On general grounds only, I believe.”</p>

<p>The Duke was more than a little relieved, but he was
content to express the fact by transferring his gaze to
the book-rest in front of him.</p>

<p>“She thinks it will be in the interests of everyone to
make the best of a most tiresome and humiliating business.
And, after all, he is certain to be Prime Minister
within the next ten years.”</p>

<p>“Who tells you that?”</p>

<p>“Last night at dinner I met Harry Truscott, and that’s
his prediction. He says Sir Dugald Maclean is the big
serpent that swallows all the little serpents.”</p>

<p>“Uncommonly true!” His Grace made a wry mouth.
“Still, that’s hardly a reason why we should receive the
reptile here.”</p>

<p>“No, of course. I quite agree. But Aunt Charlotte
thinks there is nothing to gain by standing out. Muriel
has quite made up her foolish mind. So the dignified
thing seems to be to make the best of a miserable
business.”</p>

<p>“It may be,” said his Grace. “But personally I should
be grateful if Charlotte would mind her own affairs.”</p>

<p>The tone implied quite definitely that he had no wish
to pursue the topic; nay, it even invited Sarah to make
an end of their talk and to go away as soon as possible.
Clearly he was far from understanding that it was little
more than a red herring across the trail of a sinister
intention. But the fact was revealed to him by her next
remarks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, by the way, father,” she said casually, or at least
with a lightness of tone that was misleading, “there’s one
other matter. I’ve been thinking the situation out.”</p>

<p>“Situation!” groped his Grace.</p>

<p>“That has been created.” Sarah’s tone was almost
infantile&mdash;“by your insisting that Mrs. Sanderson should
stay on.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it, what of it?”</p>

<p>“It simply makes the whole thing impossible.” Sarah
had achieved the voice of the dove. “So long as this
woman remains in the house one feels that one cannot
stay here.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because”&mdash;Sarah fixed a deliberate eye on the face
of her sire&mdash;“neither Aunt Charlotte nor I think that the
present arrangement is quite seemly.”</p>

<p class="ph2">II</p>

<p>The attack had been neatly launched, and she saw by
the look on her father’s face that it had gone right home.
She was a slow-witted, rather crass person, with a kind
of heavy conceit of her own, but like all the other Dinneford
ladies, at close quarters she was formidable. The
button was off her foil. It was her intention to wound.
And at the instant she struck, his Grace was unpleasantly
aware of that fact.</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean?” It was his recoil from the stroke.</p>

<p>“I have talked over the matter with Aunt Charlotte.
She agrees with me that the present arrangement is quite
hopeless. And she thinks that as you are unwilling for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
Mrs. Sanderson to be sent away, the only course for
Blanche, Marjorie, and myself is to leave the house.”</p>

<p>The face of her father grew a shade paler, but for the
moment that was the only expression of the inward fury.
He saw at once that the dull fool who dared to beard
him was no more than a cat’s-paw of the arch-schemer.
The mine was Charlotte’s, even if fired by a hand infinitely
less cunning.</p>

<p>“Is this a threat?” The surge of his rage was hard
to control.</p>

<p>“You leave us no alternative,” said Sarah doughtily.
“Aunt Charlotte thinks in the circumstances we shall be
fully justified in going to live with her. I think so, too;
and I don’t doubt that Blanche and Marjorie will see the
matter in the same light.”</p>

<p>“What do you think you will gain?” His voice shook
with far more than vexation. “The proposal simply
amounts to the washing of dirty linen in public.”</p>

<p>“There is such a thing as personal dignity, father,”
said Sarah in her driest tone.</p>

<p>“No doubt; but how you are going to serve it by
dancing to the piping of Charlotte I can’t for the life of
me see.”</p>

<p>Sarah, however, could see something else. The blow
had met already with some success. And she was fully
determined to follow up a first advantage.</p>

<p>“Well, father”&mdash;her words were of warriorlike conciseness&mdash;“if
you still insist on Mrs. Sanderson’s presence
here, that is the course we intend to take.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” A futile monosyllable, yet at that moment full
of meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p class="ph2">III</p>

<p>The ultimatum delivered, Sarah promptly retired.
She took away from the interview a pleasing consciousness
that the honors were with her. And this sense of
nascent victory had not grown less by half-past one when
she reached Hill Street in time to lunch with Aunt Charlotte.</p>

<p>It was a rather cheerless and ascetic meal, but both
ladies were in such excellent fighting trim that the
meagerness of the fare didn’t matter. Sarah was sure
that she had scored heavily. A well-planted bomb had
wrought visible confusion in the ranks of the foe. “He
sees that it places him in a most awkward position,” was
her summary for the grim ears of the arch-plotter.</p>

<p>“One knew it would.” There were times when Aunt
Charlotte had a striking personal resemblance to Moltke;
and just now, beyond a doubt, she bore an uncanny likeness
to that successful Prussian.</p>

<p>“He hates the idea of what he calls washing dirty linen
in public.”</p>

<p>“Lacks moral courage as usual.” The remark was
made in an undertone to the coal-scuttle.</p>

<p>“I hope&mdash;&mdash;.” But Sarah suddenly bit off the end of
her sentence. After all, there are things one cannot
discuss.</p>

<p>“You hope what?” The eye of Aunt Charlotte fixed
her like a kite.</p>

<p>“No need to say what one hopes,” said Sarah dourly.</p>

<p>“I agree.” Aunt Charlotte took a sip of hot water and
munched a peptonized biscuit with a kind of savage glee.
“But we have to remember that the ice is very thin. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
has always felt that&mdash;well, you know what one means.
One has felt sometimes that your father....”</p>

<p>Sarah agreed. For more years than she cared to remember
she....</p>

<p>“Quite so,” Aunt Charlotte took another biscuit.
“And everybody must know.... However, the time
has now come to make an end.”</p>

<p>“I am sure it has,” said Sarah.</p>

<p>“Still we are playing it up very high,” said the great
tactician. “And we shall do well to remember....”</p>

<p>“I agree,” said Sarah cryptically.</p>

<p>Misgiving they might have, but just now the uppermost
feeling was pride in their work and a secret satisfaction.
There could be no doubt that the blow had gone home.
At last they had taken the measure of his Grace, they
had found his limit, the point had been reached beyond
which he would not go.</p>

<p>“<i>Au fond</i> a coward,” Aunt Charlotte affirmed once
more, for the benefit of the coal-scuttle. And then for
the benefit of Sarah, with a ring of triumph, “Always
sets too high a value on public opinion, my dear.”</p>

<p>Such being the case the conspirators had every right
to congratulate themselves. And as if to confirm their
victory, there came presently by telephone a most urgent
message from Mount Street. Charlotte was to go round
at once.</p>

<p>“There, what did I tell you!” said that lady. And she
sublimely ordered her chariot.</p>

<p class="ph2">IV</p>

<p>Enroute to Bridport House, the redoubtable Charlotte
did not allow herself to question that the foe was at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
point of hauling down the flag. His hurry to do so was a
little absurd, but it was so like him to throw up the sponge
at the mere threat of publicity. This indecent haste to
come to terms deepened a contempt which had lent a
grim enjoyment to a long hostility.</p>

<p>However, the reception in store for her ladyship in the
smaller library did much to modify her views. She was
received by her brother with an air of menace which almost
verged upon truculence.</p>

<p>“Charlotte”&mdash;there was a boldness of attack for which
she was by no means prepared&mdash;“the time has now come
to make an end of this comedy.”</p>

<p>She fully agreed, yet the sixth sense given to woman
found occasion to warn her that she didn’t know in the
least to what she was agreeing.</p>

<p>“You would have it so, you know.”</p>

<p>He was asked succinctly to explain.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a long story.” Already there was a note in
the mordant voice which his sister heard for the first
time. “A long, a strange, and if you will, a romantic
story. And let me say that it is by no wish of my own
that I tell it. However, Fate is stronger than we are
in these little matters, and no doubt wiser.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” said Charlotte drily. But somehow that
note in his voice made her uneasy, and the look in his
face seemed to hold her every nerve in a vise. “You are
speaking in riddles, my friend,” she added with a little
flutter of impatience.</p>

<p>“It may be so, but before I go on I want you clearly
to understand that it is you, not I, who insist on bringing
the roof down upon us.”</p>

<p>Charlotte’s only reply was to sit very upright, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
her sarcastic mouth drawn in a rigid line. She could not
understand in the least what her brother was driving
at, but in his manner was a new, a strange intensity which
somehow gave her a feeling of profound discomfort.</p>

<p>“You don’t realize what you are doing,” he said.
“Still you are not to blame for that. But the time has
come to pull aside the curtain, and to let you know what
we all owe a woman who has been cruelly maligned.”</p>

<p>Charlotte stiffened perceptibly at these words. After
all, the case was no more and no less than for more
than twenty years she had known it to be. Still open
confession was good for the soul! It was a sordid
intrigue, an intrigue of a nature which simply made her
loathe the man opposite. How dare he&mdash;and with a
servant in his own house! If looks could have slain,
his Grace would have been spared the necessity to continue
a very irksome narrative.</p>

<p>“Make provision for her and send her away.” The
sharp voice was like the crack of a gun.</p>

<p>The Duke raised himself slowly and painfully on his
elbows. “Hold your tongue,” he said. And his eyes
struck at her. “Be good enough to forgo all comment
until you have heard the whole story.”</p>

<p>It was trying Charlotte highly, but she set herself determinedly
to listen.</p>

<p>“Do you remember when she first came here, as second
maid to poor Rachel, a fine, upstanding, gray-eyed Scots
girl, one of the most beautiful creatures you ever saw?
Do you remember her devotion? No, I see you have
forgotten.” He closed his eyes for an instant, while the
woman opposite kept hers fixed steadily upon him.
“Well, I don’t excuse myself. But Rachel and I were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
never happy; the plain truth is we ought not to have
married. It was a family arrangement and it recoiled
upon us. The Paringtons are an effete lot and the same
can be said of us Dinnefords. Nature asked for something
else.”</p>

<p>Now that he had unlocked the doors of memory a
growing emotion became too much for the Duke, and for
a moment he could not go on. His sister, in the meantime,
continued to hold him with pitiless eyes.</p>

<p>“One might say,” he went on, “that it was the call
of the blood. I remember her first as the factor’s
daughter, a long-legged creature in a red tam-o’-shanter,
running about the woods of Ardnaleuchan. You haven’t
forgotten Donald Sanderson, the father?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t forgotten him,” said Charlotte.</p>

<p>“That was a fine fellow. ‘Man Donald’ as our father
used to call him, helped me to stalk my first stag. We
ranged the woods together days on end. I sometimes
think I owe more to that man than to any other human
being.”</p>

<p>Again he was silent, but the eyes of his sister never
left his face.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was the call of the blood.” He sighed as he
passed his handkerchief over his face which was now
gray and glistening. “As I say, Rachel and I ought
not to have married; we didn’t suit each other. Our
marriage was a family arrangement. It had almost
ceased to be tolerable long before the end, but we kept
our compact as well as we could, for we were determined
that other people should not suffer. And then
came Rachel’s long illness, and the girl’s wonderful devotion&mdash;do
you remember how Rachel would rather have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
her with her than any of the nurses? And then she
died, and of course that altered everything.”</p>

<p>Lady Wargrave sat as if carved out of stone, her eyes
still upon the bleak face of the invalid. “Is that all?”
she said.</p>

<p>“No, it is not. There’s more to tell.”</p>

<p>“Tell it then so that we may have done with it.” Charlotte’s
voice quivered.</p>

<p>“Very well, since you insist.” The softness of the
tone was surprising, yet to Charlotte it said nothing.
“Rachel died and everything, as I say, was altered. ‘Man
Donald’s’ daughter became the only woman who ever
really meant anything to me. Somehow I felt I couldn’t
do without her. And to make an end of a long and
tedious story, finally I married her.”</p>

<p>“You <i>married</i> her!” Lady Wargrave sat as if she
had swallowed a poker.</p>

<p>“Yes, but before doing so I made a condition. Things
were to go on as they were, provided....”</p>

<p>“... provided!” Excitement fought curiosity in
Charlotte’s angry voice.</p>

<p>“... she didn’t bring a boy into the world.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t understand.” Charlotte’s voice
cracked in the middle.</p>

<p>“It was quite a simple arrangement, and in the circumstances
it seemed the best. So long as there was no
man child to complicate the thing unduly, the world
was to be kept out of our secret. At the time it seemed
wise and right to do that. Otherwise it would have
meant a fearful upset for everybody.”</p>

<p>“Is one to understand,” gasped Charlotte, “that when
Rachel died you actually married this&mdash;this woman?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>The Duke nodded. “But I made the condition that
our secret should be rigidly guarded&mdash;always assuming
that Fate did not prove too much for us. She went
to the little house on the river at Buntisford, where
I used to go for the fishing and shooting. And she gave
me ten years of happiness&mdash;the only happiness I have
known. And then came my breakdown, since when she
has nursed me with more than a wife’s devotion.” His
voice failed suddenly and he lay back in his chair with
closed eyes.</p>

<p>It was left to Charlotte to break the irksome silence
that followed.</p>

<p>“How could you be so mad!” She spoke under her
breath not intending her words to be heard, but a quick
ear caught them.</p>

<p>“Nay,” he said in the tone that was so new to her,
“it was the only thing to do. It was the call of the
blood. And this was a devoted woman, a woman one
could trust implicitly.”</p>

<p>“Madness, my friend, madness!”</p>

<p>He shook his head somberly. “All life is a madness,
if you will a divine madness. It is a madness that damns
the consequences. By taking too much thought for the
morrow we entomb ourselves. When Rachel died life
meant for me the woman of my choice. And, Charlotte,
let me say this”&mdash;he raised himself in his chair and
looked at his sister fixedly&mdash;“she is the best woman I
have ever known.”</p>

<p>For a moment she sat a picture of bewilderment, and
then in a voice torn with emotion she said, “Out of regard
for the others things had better go on as they are.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
But perhaps you will tell me, are there any children of
this marriage?”</p>

<p>“There is one child.”</p>

<p>Charlotte caught her breath sharply.</p>

<p>“A girl. And in accordance with our compact she
has been brought up in complete ignorance of her paternity.
It seemed wise that she should know nothing.
Her mother had her reared among her own people, because
it was her mother’s express wish that the children
of the first marriage should suffer no prejudice; and at
the present time neither the girl herself nor the world
at large is any the wiser.”</p>

<p>Charlotte began to breathe a little more freely. “At
all events,” she said, “that fact seems to confirm one’s
opinion that things had better go on as they are.”</p>

<p>But her brother continued to gaze at her with somber
eyes. “Charlotte,” he said very slowly, “you have forced
me to tell a story I had hoped would never be told in
my lifetime. I have had to suffer your suspicions, but
now that you are in the secret, you must share its responsibilities.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you,” said Lady Wargrave bluntly.</p>

<p>“I will explain. A horrible injustice has been done
this girl, the child of the second marriage. So much
is clear to you, no doubt?”</p>

<p>Lady Wargrave’s only reply was to tighten her lips.</p>

<p>“You wish me to be still more explicit?”</p>

<p>She invited him to be so.</p>

<p>“Well, as far as I can I will be.” His air was simple
matter of fact. “But I warn you that we are now at
the point where we have to realize that Fate is so much
stronger than ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>A momentary hesitation drew a harsh, “Go on, let me
hear the worst.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you guess who this girl is?” he said abruptly.</p>

<p>“Pray, why should one?”</p>

<p>“She is the girl Jack wants to marry.”</p>

<p>A long silence followed this announcement. It would
have been kind perhaps had he helped his sister to break
it, but a clear perception of the first thought in her mind
had raised a barrier. With a patience that was half-malicious
he waited for a speech that he knew was bound
to come.</p>

<p>“It was to have been expected,” she said at last with
something perilously like a snarl of subdued anger.</p>

<p>“Why expected?” They were the words for which he
had waited, and he seized them promptly.</p>

<p>“She has been too much for you, my friend.”</p>

<p>“Whom do you mean?”</p>

<p>“The mother, of course. She has planned this marriage
so that she might be revenged upon us here.”</p>

<p>He was quite ready to do Charlotte the justice of allowing
that it was the only view she was likely to hold. The
pressure of mere facts was too heavy. Words of his
would be powerless against them; and yet he was determined
to use every means at his command to clear
that suspicion from her mind.</p>

<p>“I hope you will believe me when I tell you she is
entirely innocent,” he said in a voice of sudden emotion.</p>

<p>Charlotte slowly shook her head, but it was a gesture
of defeat. She was beyond malice now.</p>

<p>“Charlotte, I give you my word that she had no part
in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>His sister looked at him pityingly. “It is impossible
to believe that,” she said without bitterness.</p>

<p>“So I see. But it is my duty to convince you.”</p>

<p>For a moment he fought a growing emotion, and then
his mind suddenly made up, he pressed the button of the
electric bell that was near his elbow.</p>

<p class="ph2">V</p>

<p>The familiar summons was answered by Harriet herself.
As she came into the room her rather scared eyes
were caught at once by the profile of the dowager. But
the reception in store for her was far from being of
the kind she had reason to expect, for which she had
had too little time to prepare.</p>

<p>To begin with Lady Wargrave rose to receive her.
And that stately and considered act was supplemented
by the simple words of the Duke.</p>

<p>“She knows everything,” he said from the depths of
his invalid chair, without a suspicion of theatricality.</p>

<p>Harriet, all the color struck from her face, shrank back,
a picture of horror and timidity.</p>

<p>“Sit down, my dear, and let us hold a little family
council.” That note of intimacy and affection was so
strange in Charlotte’s ear, that it hit her almost as hard
as the previous words had hit the wife of his bosom.
However, the two ladies sat, and the Duke with a nonchalance
that hardly seemed credible, went on in a
quietly domestic voice, as he turned to Harriet again.
“We shall value your help and advice, if you feel inclined
to give it, in this matter of Mary and the young
man Dinneford.”</p>

<p>At this amazing speech Lady Wargrave stirred uneasily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
on her cushion of thorns. She breathed hard, her
mordant mouth grew set, in her grim eyes were unutterable
things.</p>

<p>“One moment, Johnnie,” she interposed. “Does Mrs.&mdash;er
Sanderson quite understand what it means to us?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” he said, “no one better.” The depth of
the tone expressed far more than those dry words. “It
may help matters,” he added, turning to Harriet again,
“if I say at once that we are going to ask you to make
two decisions in the name of the people you have served
so long and so faithfully. And the first is this: Since,
as you will see I have been forced, much against my will,
to let a third person into our secret, you have now the
opportunity of taking your true position in the sight of
the world.”</p>

<p>Lady Wargrave shivered. Somehow this was a turn
of the game she had not been able to foresee.</p>

<p>“That is to say,” the Duke went on, “you have now,
as far as I am concerned, full liberty to assume your true
style and dignity as mistress here. For more than twenty
years you have sacrificed yourself for others, but the
time has now come when you need do so no longer.
What do you say?”</p>

<p>Harriet did not speak. Lady Wargrave was silent
also, but a kind of stony horror was freezing her. The
whole situation had become so fantastic that she felt the
inadequacy of her emotions.</p>

<p>“You shall have a perfectly free hand,” the Duke went
on. “Assume your position now, and good care shall
be taken that you are amply maintained in it. What do
you say, my dear?” he added gently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>Tears were melting her now, and she was unable to
speak.</p>

<p>“Well, think it over,” said his Grace. “And be assured
that whichever course you take, it will be the right
one. We owe you more than we can repay. However,
that is only one issue, and there is another, which is
hardly less important.”</p>

<p>Lady Wargrave stirred again on her cushion. For a
moment there was not a sound to be heard in the room.</p>

<p>“You see,” the Duke went on, “I’ve been giving
anxious thought to&mdash;to this girl of ours. And I really
don’t see, having regard to all the circumstances, why
justice should any longer be denied her. No matter who
the man is, he is lucky to get her. And, as I understand,
they are a very devoted couple.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they are!” The words were Harriet’s and
they were uttered in a tone broken by emotion.</p>

<p>“Well, you shall make the decision,” he said. “You
know, of course, how the matter stands.” Harriet
bowed her head in assent, and his Grace turned an eye
bright with malice upon the Dowager. “You see, Charlotte,
this girl of ours, brought up in a very humble
way, and left to fight her own battle, under the providence
of the good God, absolutely declines to come
among us unless she has the full and free consent of the
head of the clan. So far that consent has not been given,
and if in the course of the next week it is not forthcoming,
the young man Dinneford threatens to return
to Canada.”</p>

<p>“I see.” The walls of Charlotte’s world had fallen in,
her deepest feelings had been outraged, but she was still
perfect mistress of herself. She turned her hard eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
upon Harriet, but in them now was a look very different
from the one that had been wont to regard the housekeeper.</p>

<p>Much had happened in a very little time, but to the
last a fine tactician, Charlotte had contrived to keep her
head. She was in the presence of calamity, she had met
a blow that would have broken a weaker person in
pieces, but already a line of action was formed in her
mind. One thing alone could save them, and that the
continued goodwill of the woman they had so long misjudged
and traduced.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Sanderson”&mdash;she used the old name unconsciously&mdash;“we
owe you a great deal.” It was not easy
to make the admission, even if common justice rather
than policy called for it. “I hope now you will let us
add to the debt.”</p>

<p>The Duke was forced to admire the dignity and the
directness of the appeal. He knew how hard she had
been hit. But that was not all. Marking his sister’s
tone, intently watching her grim face, he saw how completely
her attitude had changed. The other woman had
conquered, but in spite of all he had suffered at the
hands of Charlotte, it was difficult not to feel a certain
respect as well as a certain pity for her in the hour of
her defeat.</p>

<p>By this, Harriet, too, had become mistress of herself.
She, also, had suffered much, but she had never played
for victory, and she was very far from the thought of it
now. “I have but one wish,” she said.</p>

<p>“And that is?” His tone was strangely gentle for
her voice had failed suddenly.</p>

<p>“To do what is right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>The simplicity of the words held them silent. Brother
and sister looked at her with a kind of awe in their eyes.
It was as if another world had opened to their rather
bewildered gaze.</p>

<p>“I want to do right to those who have been so good to
me, and to my father and my grandfather before me.”</p>

<p>Somehow that speech, gentleness itself, yet sharp as
a sword, brought the blood to Lady Wargrave’s face.
In a flash she saw and felt the justification of her
brother’s amazing deed. This devoted woman in her selflessness
held the master key to life and Fate; in a flash
of insight she saw that groundlings and grovelers like
themselves were powerless before it. Somehow those
words, that bearing, solved the mystery. She could no
longer blame her brother; he had been caught in the toils
of an irresistible force.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Sanderson”&mdash;there was reverence now in the
harsh voice&mdash;“you are the best judge of what is right.
We are content to leave the matter to your discretion.”
Even if the accomplished tactician was uppermost in
Charlotte’s words, in the act of uttering them was a large
rather noble simplicity.</p>

<p>The Duke nodded acquiescence.</p>

<p>“I should like the present arrangement to go on,” said
Harriet. “Perhaps the truth will have to be known
some time, but let it come out after we are dead, when
it can hurt nobody.”</p>

<p>Lady Wargrave drew a long breath of relief and gratitude.</p>

<p>“You are very wise,” she said.</p>

<p>But the Duke took her up at once with a saturnine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
smile. “You seem to forget, Charlotte, that the existing
arrangement can no longer go on.”</p>

<p>“Pray, why not?”</p>

<p>“You have just been kind enough to tell us,” he said
bitingly, “that Sarah and the girls are going to live with
you at Hill Street&mdash;except, of course, on one condition!”</p>

<p>Their eyes met. Suddenly they smiled frostily at each
other.</p>

<p>“If you care to leave the matter to me,” said Charlotte,
“I will see to that.”</p>

<p>“But that woman, Sarah,” he persisted. “She’s so
obstinate that we may have to tell her.”</p>

<p>Charlotte shook her head doughtily. “I think I shall
be able to manage her.”</p>

<p>“So be it.” He smiled grimly. “Anyhow we shall be
very glad to leave that matter in your hands.”</p>

<p>“With perfect safety, I think you may do that.” And
Charlotte, sore and embittered as she was, rounded off
this comfortable assurance with a long sigh of relief.</p>

ARDORS AND ENDURANCES</h2></div>

<p class="ph2">I</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“T</span>here,</span>” cried Mary upon a note of triumph.</p>

<p>An excited wave of that delightful journal, the
<i>Morning Post</i>, accompanied the pæan. And then
it was hurled across the breakfast-table with deft precision
into the lap of Milly.</p>

<p>“A marriage has been arranged,” said the courier of
Hymen, “and will shortly take place between Charles,
only son of the late Simeon Cheesewright and Mrs.
Cheesewright, of Streatham Hill, and Mildred Ulrica,
younger daughter of the late H. Blandish Wren and Mrs.
Wren, 5, Victoria Mansions, Broad Place, Knightsbridge,
W.”</p>

<p>Again arose the triumphant cry.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Wren, excavating the interior of a boiled
egg, felt it to be her duty to check this unbridled enthusiasm.
For some days past, with rather mournful
iteration, she had let it be known that the impending
announcement could not hope to receive her unqualified
approval.</p>

<p>In the first place, as she frankly admitted, the Marquis
had spoiled her. She had to confess that he had proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
sadly lacking in backbone when brought to the test, but
his sternest critics could not deny that “before everything
he was a gentleman.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren ascribed her own pure taste in manhood
to the fact that she had begun her career in the legitimate
drama under the ægis of Mr. Painswick at the Theater
Royal, Edinburgh. He, too, had been before everything
a gentleman. Mr. Painswick had shaped Lydia Mifflin,
as she was then, in his own inimitable mold. Upon a
day she was to play Grace to his Digby Grant in “The
Two Roses.” Then it was, as she had always felt, that
she had touched her high-water mark; and the signal
occasion was ever afterwards a beacon in her life. From
that bright hour the Mr. Painswick standard had regulated
the fair Lydia’s survey of the human male. Even
the late lamented Mr. H. Blandish Wren, who was without
a peer in “straight” comedy, whose Steggles in “London
Assurance” had never been surpassed, even that paladin&mdash;&mdash;.
Still it isn’t quite fair to give away State
secrets!</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren had once said of Charles Cheesewright
“that he was not out of the top drawer.” However, if
he was not of the caste of Vere de Vere she had to own
that “he had points.” He was one of those young men
who mean more than they say, who do better than they
promise, who clothe their thoughts with actions rather
than words. Also, he had two motors&mdash;a Daimler and
a Rolls-Royce, he had rooms in the Albany, and though
perhaps just a little inclined to overdress, he had such
a sure taste in jewelry that he took his fiancée once a
week to Cartier’s. And beyond everything else, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
the supreme advantage over my lord that he knew his
own mind pretty clearly.</p>

<p>In the opinion of Princess Bedalia, Milly was an extremely
lucky girl. Her young man was a simple, good
fellow, honest as the day, he was incapable of any kind
of meanness, he was very rich, and, what was hardly
less important, he was very much in love. Milly, however,
who had her mother’s knack of seeing men and
events objectively, did not yield a final graceful assent
until she extorted a promise from Mr. Charles that he
would suffer the rape of his mustache, at the best a mere
scrub of an affair, and that he would solemnly eschew
yellow plush hats which made him look like a piano-tuner.</p>

<p>Still, on this heroic morning, in the middle of July,
Mrs. Wren seemed less pleased with the world than she
had reason to be. She did some sort of justice to her
egg, but she wouldn’t look at the marmalade. If the
truth must be told, a rather histrionic mind was still
haunted by the shade of the noble Marquis. As Milly,
in one of her moments of engaging candor, had told
Mary already, as far as her mother was concerned Wrexham
had simply queered the pitch for everybody.</p>

<p>Certainly that lady felt it to be her duty to rebuke
Mary’s enthusiasm. There was nothing to make a song
about. Milly was simply throwing herself away. If
everyone had had their rights, she would have been Lady
W., with a coronet on her notepaper. As it was, there
was really nothing so very wonderful in being the wife
of an overdressed tobacconist.</p>

<p>Mary cried “Shame,” and for her pains was sternly
admonished. One who has made such hay of her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
dazzling matrimonial chances must not venture to say a
word. She who might have queened it among the highest
in the land merely by substituting the big word “Yes”
for the small word “No” must forever hold her peace on
this vexed subject. But Mary was in such wild spirits
at the announcement in the <i>Morning Post</i> that she refused
to be browbeaten. She continued to sing the
praises of “Charley” in spite of the clear annoyance of
Mrs. Wren. The good lady was unable to realize that
the girl was trying with might and main to stifle an ache
that was almost intolerable.</p>

<p>“What ho!” Milly suddenly exclaimed, withdrawing
a slightly <i>retroussé</i> but decidedly charming nose from
Page 5 of the <i>Morning Post</i>, “so they’ve actually made
Uncle Jacob a Bart.”</p>

<p>“My dear, you mean a baronet. Who?&mdash;made who
a baronet?” Mrs. Wren laid down an imperious egg-spoon.</p>

<p>“Jacob Cheesewright, Esquire, M.P. for Bradbury, a
rich manufacturer and prominent philanthropist. He’s
in the honor list just issued by the King’s government.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” Mary indulged in an enthusiastic wave
of the tea-pot which happily was rather less than half
full. “Which means, my dear Miss Wren, that one of
these days there’s just a chance of your being my lady.”</p>

<p>“As though that could possibly matter!” cried Milly
upon a note of the finest scorn imaginable.</p>

<p>“As though that could possibly matter!” Mary’s reproduction
of the note in question was so humorously
exact that it sent her victim into a fit of laughter.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Wren had her word to say on the subject. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
her opinion, which was that of all sensible people, it mattered
immensely.</p>

<p>“As though it could!” persisted Milly.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Mrs. Wren, “that is shallow and ignorant.
A baronetcy is a baronetcy. All people of
breeding think so, anyway.”</p>

<p>The prospect of Uncle Jacob’s elevation had already
been canvassed in Broad Place by Charles, his nephew.
There was evidently something in the wind Whitehall
way. Uncle Jacob had professed such a heroic indifference
to Aunt Priscilla’s intelligent anticipations, that
even Charles, his nephew, the simplest of simple souls,
and a singularly unworldly young man, had been constrained
to take an interest in the matter. As for Aunt
Priscilla, she had been in such a state of flutter for the
past two months, that the upper servants at Thole Park,
Maidstone, even had visions of an earldom. Still, as
Mr. Bryant, the butler, who in his distinguished youth
had graduated at Bridport House, Mayfair, remarked to
Mrs. Jennings the housekeeper in his statesmanlike way,
“The Limit for baby’s underclothing is a baronetcy.”</p>

<p class="ph2">II</p>

<p>Breakfast was just at an end when the trim parlormaid
came into the room with a portentous-looking
milliner’s box. It had that moment arrived, and on examination
was found to contain a long coat of sable.
This enchanting garment was with Mary’s best wishes
for future happiness.</p>

<p>The donor was scolded roundly for her lavishness, but
Milly was delighted by the gift, and Mrs. Wren, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
had professed a stern determination to be no longer
friends with Mary was rather touched. She well knew
that she was a person “to bank on.” Besides, Mrs. Wren
had an honest admiration for a fine talent and the unassumingness
with which it was worn. She was incapable
of making an enemy, for her one idea was to
bring pleasure to other people. If ever human creature
had been designed for happiness it must have been this
girl, yet none could have been more fully bent on casting
it willfully away.</p>

<p>As a fact, both Milly and her mother had been much
troubled by the course of recent events. The previous
afternoon Jack had taken a sad farewell of his friends
in Broad Place. His passage was already booked in the
<i>Arcadia</i>, which that very Saturday was to sail from
Liverpool to New York. All his hopes had proved futile,
all his arguments vain. Mary could not be induced to
change her mind, which even at the eleventh hour he had
ventured to think was just possible. In those last desperate
moments, strength of will had enabled her to stick
to her resolve. And in the absence of any intimation
from Bridport House the Tenderfoot had been driven
to carry out his threat. Yet up till the very last he had
tried his utmost to persuade the girl he loved to merge
her own life in his and accompany him to that new world
where a career awaited him.</p>

<p>Perhaps these efforts had not been wholly reasonable.
She had a real vocation for the theater if ever girl had,
even if he had a real vocation for jobbing land. But
allowance has to be made for a strong man in love. He
was in sorry case, poor fellow, but her sense of duty to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
others was so strong, that even if it meant tragic unhappiness
for both, as it surely must, she still sought
the courage not to yield.</p>

<p>Such a decision was going to cost a very great deal.
The previous afternoon, at the moment of parting,
she had been fully aware of that, and hour by hour
since she had realized it with a growing intensity. A
stern effort of the will had been needed for Princess
Bedalia to achieve her five hundred-and-sixty-second appearance
that evening; she had spent a miserable night
and now, in spite of the whole-heartedness with which
she threw herself into Milly’s affairs, her laugh was
pitched a little too high.</p>

<p>Since the visit to Bridport House she had come to
know her own mind quite definitely. She was deeply in
love with Jack, but unless the powers that were gave
consent, she was now resolved never to marry him. In
vain her friends continued to assure her that such an
attitude was wrong. In vain the Tenderfoot declared
it to be simply preposterous. Cost what it might, it had
become a point of honor not to yield. To one of such
clear vision, with, as it seemed, a rather uncanny insight
into the workings of worlds beyond her own, it was
of vital importance to study the interests of Bridport
House.</p>

<p>Milly, even if very angry with her friend, could not
help admiring this devotion to a quixotic sense of right,
and the force of character which faced the issue so unflinchingly.
She could not begin to understand the point
of view, but she well knew what it was going to cost.
And this morning, in spite of the pleasant and piquant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
drama of her own affairs, she could not rid herself of a
feeling of distress on Mary’s account. Now it had come
“to footing the bill,” a heavy price would have to be
paid. And to Milly’s shrewd, engagingly material mind,
the whole situation was exasperating.</p>

<p>So much for the thoughts uppermost in a loyal heart,
while the misguided cause of them danced a <i>pas seul</i> in
honor of the morning’s news. Milly, indeed, as she
gazed in the glass over the chimney-piece to see what
sort of a figure she made in the coat of sable, was much
nearer tears than was either seemly or desirable. Still,
in spite of that, she was able to muster a healthy curiosity
upon the subject of her appearance. Fur has a
trick of making common people look more common, and
uncommon people look more uncommon, a trite fact of
which Milly, the astute, was well aware. It was pleasant
to find at any rate that a moment’s fleeting survey set all
her doubts at rest upon that important point. The coat,
a dream of beauty, became her quite miraculously. What
a virtue there was in that deep, rich gloss! It gave new
values to the eyes, the hair, the rounded chin, even the
piquant nose of the wearer.</p>

<p>“You’re a dear!” Milly burst out, as she turned aside
from the glass. But the person to whom the tribute was
offered was quite absorbed in looking through the open
window. Indeed, at that very moment a succession of
royal toots from a motor horn ascended from the precincts
of Broad Place, and Mary ran out on to the
veranda with a view halloa. Then, her face full of
humor and eloquence, she turned to look back into the
room with the thrilling announcement: “Charley’s here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p class="ph2">III</p>

<p>In two minutes, or rather less as time is measured in
Elysium, Mr. Charles Cheesewright had entered that
pleasant room with all the gay assurance of an accepted
suitor.</p>

<p>“How awfully well it reads, doesn’t it?” he said, taking
up the <i>Morning Post</i> with the fingers of a lover.</p>

<p>“Uncle Jacob’s baronetcy?” said Mary, with an eye of
bold mischief.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! That’s a bit of a bore,” said Mr. Charles
with a polite grimace.</p>

<p>“Why a bore?”</p>

<p>“Uncle Jacob has no heir and he’s trying to arrange
for me to be the second bart.”</p>

<p>Princess Bedalia looked with a royal air at her favorite.
“The truth is, dear Charles, you are shamelessly pleased
about the whole matter.”</p>

<p>“Well, ye-es, I am.” Charles was hopelessly cornered,
but like any other self-respecting Briton he was quite
determined to put as good a face as possible upon a most
damaging admission. “I am so awfully pleased for
Milly. And, of course, for Uncle Jacob.”</p>

<p>“Not to mention Aunt Priscilla,” interposed Milly. It
was her proud boast that she had already tried a fall
with Aunt Priscilla, had tried it, moreover, pretty successfully.
That lady, within her own orbit, was a great
light, but Miss Wren had proved very well able for her
so far. The Aunt Priscillas of the world were not going
to harry Miss Wren, and it was by no means clear that
this simple fact did not count as much to her honor in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
the sight of Uncle Jacob as it undoubtedly did in the
sight of Charles, his nephew.</p>

<p>At any rate, Mr. Charles had come that morning to
Broad Place on a diplomatic mission. It seemed that
Uncle Jacob had made the sporting suggestion that the
happy pair should motor down to Thole Park, Maidstone,
for luncheon, that Charles, whose only merit in the sight
of heaven was that he was “plus one” at North Berwick,
should afterwards give careful consideration to the new
nine-hole course which had been laid out in front of the
house by the renowned Alec Thomson of Cupar, while
Milly had a little heart-to-heart talk with Aunt Priscilla.</p>

<p>In a word, it began to look like being quite a good
world for Charles and Milly. And even Mrs. Wren was
constrained to admit it. Sheer human merit was becoming
a little too much for the higher criticism. And daily
these twain were discovering new beauties in each other.
For one thing, Charles’s upper lip was now as smooth
as a baby’s, and a mouth so firm and manly was thereby
disclosed that it really seemed a pity to hide it. Moreover,
for a fortnight past, in subtle, unsuspected ways he
had been bursting forth into fine qualities. This morning,
for instance, he seemed to have added a cubit to his
stature. He was in the habit of saying in regard to
himself that “he was not a flyer,” but really if you saw
him at the angle Milly did, and you came to think about
him in her rational manner, it began to seem after all
he might turn out a bit of one. If only he could be
persuaded to give up his piano-tuner’s hat there would
be hope for him anyway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p class="ph2">IV</p>

<p>Milly had scarcely left the room to put on her things
before she was back in it. And she returned in such
a state of excitement that she could hardly speak. The
cause of it, moreover, following hard upon her heels, was
a wholly unexpected visitor.</p>

<p>“He was just coming in at the front door,” Milly
explained, as soon as the state of her emotions would
allow her to do so. “I was never so taken aback in my
life. Why, a feather would have downed me.”</p>

<p>In that moment of drama it was not too much to say
that a feather would have had an equal effect upon Mary.
If human resolve stood for anything, and it stood for a
good deal in the case of Jack Dinneford, he should have
been on his way to Liverpool. At six o’clock the previous
evening they had parted heroically, not expecting
to see each other again. For seventeen hours or so,
they had been steeling their wills miserably. About
2 a.m., the hour when ghosts walk and pixies dance the
foxtrot, both had felt that, after all, they would not be
strong enough to bear the self-inflicted blow. But daylight
had found them true to the faith that was in them.
She had just enough fortitude not to telephone a change
of mind, he was just man enough to decide not to miss
the 10.5 from Euston.</p>

<p>Still, when the best has been said for it, the human
will is but a trivial affair. Man is not much when the
Fates begin to weave their magic web. A taxi was actually
at the door of Jack’s chambers, nay, his luggage had
even been strapped into the front of the vehicle, when
there came an urgent message by telephone from Bridport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
House to say that his Grace most particularly desired
that Mr. Dinneford and Miss Lawrence would come
to luncheon at half-past one.</p>

<p>What was a man to do? To obey the command was,
of course, to forgo all hope of sailing by the <i>Arcadia</i>.
To ignore it was to forgo all hope of entering Elysium.
In justice to Mr. Dinneford it took him rather less than
one minute to decide. His servant was promptly ordered
to unship his gear and dismiss the taxi.</p>

<p>It was the nearest possible shave. His Grace had
run matters so fine, that had he delayed his communication
another two minutes, the Tenderfoot would have
been on his way to New York. Some miraculous change
of plan had occurred at the fifty-ninth minute of the
eleventh hour. Exactly what it was must now be the
business of a distracted lover to find out.</p>

<p>Jack’s totally unexpected return to Broad Place was
in itself an epic. And his unheralded appearance had
such an effect upon Mary, upon Milly, upon Mrs. Wren,
that he regretted not having had the forethought to telephone
his change of plans. He came as a bolt from
the blue, bringing with him an immensely difficult
moment; and the presence of Mr. Charles Cheesewright,
of whom Jack only knew by hearsay, undoubtedly added
to its embarrassments.</p>

<p>Before anything could be done, even before the excited
Milly could interpose a “Tell me, is it all right?” it was
necessary for these paladins to be made known to each
other. There was wariness on the part of both in the
process. Neither was quite able to accept the other on
trust. But a brief taking of the moral temperature by
two members of the sex which inclines to reserve convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
the one that Wrexham’s successor had the air and
the look of a good chap, and what was quite as important,
convinced the other that the heir to the dukedom
was not the least of a swankpot. All of which was so
far excellent.</p>

<p>A desire to ask a thousand questions was simply burning
holes in Milly. But she had to endure the torments
of martyrdom. Questions could not be asked in the
presence of Charles. It called for a great effort to behave
as if the bottom had not fallen out of the universe.
In the most heroic way she kept the conversation at a
diplomatic level, remarking among other things that it
was an ideal day for motoring, which finally reminded
her that she must really go and put on her hat.</p>

<p>“And don’t forget a thick veil,” Mary called after her,
in a voice of superhuman detachment.</p>

<p>The business of not letting the innocent Charles into
the secret was a superb piece of comedy. There is really
no need to write novels or to go to the play. They are
the stuff our daily lives are made of. The way in which
these four people set themselves to hoodwink a Simple
Simon of a fifth was quite a rich bit of humor. Little
recked Mr. Charles Cheesewright that the heavens had
just opened in Broad Place.</p>

<p>At last Milly returned <i>cap-à-pie</i>, and then by the mercy
of Divine Providence Mr. Charles suddenly remembered
that it was a long way to Maidstone and that it was now
a quarter past eleven.</p>

<p>“I’m quite ready when you are,” said Milly to her
cavalier, with all the guile of a young female serpent.
Mr. Charles shook hands gravely and Britishly all round,
and Mary wished them a pleasant journey, and Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
Wren “hoped they would wrap up well,” and then Milly
stepped deftly back three paces from the door, saying,
“You know the way down, Charley,” as clear an intimation
as any young man could desire that it was up to him
to lead it.</p>

<p>Charles led the way accordingly, and then came Milly’s
chance.</p>

<p>“What <i>has</i> happened?”</p>

<p>“Uncle Albert has sent for us.”</p>

<p>“For both?”</p>

<p>“For both!”</p>

<p>Just for a moment Mary’s feelings nearly proved too
much for her. Having come to despair of Bridport
House, there had been no reason to hope for this sudden
change of front. She simply couldn’t fathom it. That
was also true of Milly. And as the significance of the
whole thing rushed upon that imperious creature, she
turned to Mary in the manner of Helen, the Spartan
Queen. “A last word to you, Miss Lawrence!” Her
voice trembled with excitement. “If you do anything
idiotic, I’ll never speak to you again. And that’s
official!”</p>

<p class="ph2">V</p>

<p>As the crow flies, it is just nine minutes from Broad
Place to Bridport House. Therefore they had time to
burn. And as it was such a perfect day for motoring,
it was a day equally well adapted for sitting under the
trees in the Park.</p>

<p><i>Force majeure</i> was applied so vigorously by Mrs.
Wren, with timely aid from the Tenderfoot, that Mary
was not given half a chance to jib at this new and amazing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
turn of fortune’s shuttle. She must wear her new
hat with the roses&mdash;Mrs. Wren. She must wear
Raquin’s biscuit-colored masterpiece&mdash;Mr. Dinneford.
Her diamond earrings thought Mrs. Wren. Mr. Dinneford
thought her old-fashioned seed pearl. There was
never really any question of her going to luncheon at
Bridport House at 1.30. Her friends and counselors did
not even allow it to arise. The only thing that need
trouble her was how she looked when she got there.</p>

<p>En route she made a picture of immense distinction
beyond a doubt. Whether it was the hat with the roses,
or the sunshine of July, or the dress of simple muslin,
which on second thoughts seemed more in keeping with
the occasion than the Raquin masterpiece, and in the
opinion of Mrs. Wren had the further merit “that it gave
her eyes a chance,” or her favorite earrings which Aunt
Harriet had given her as a little girl; or the fact that Jack
walked beside her, and that Happiness is still the greatest
of Court painters, who shall say?&mdash;but in the course of
a pilgrimage from Albert Gate to the Marble Arch and
half way back again, she certainly attracted more than
her share of the public notice. In fact, with her fine
height and her lithe grace she actually provoked a hook-nosed,
hard-featured dame in a sort of high-hung
barouche to turn in the most deliberate manner and look
at her. Or it may have been because the Tenderfoot in
passing had raised a reluctant, semi-ironical hat.</p>

<p>“Aunt Charlotte,” said he.</p>

<p>“I hope Aunt Charlotte is not as disagreeable as she
looks,” was Mary’s thought, but doubtless remembering
in the nick of time Talleyrand’s famous maxim, she
merely said, “What a <i>clever</i> face!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>“Is it?” said Jack, unconcernedly. But his mind was
on other things, perhaps.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it <i>was</i> on other things.</p>

<p>“Let’s sit here five minutes,” he said, as they came to
a couple of vacant chairs. “Then I’ll tell you a bit of
news.”</p>

<p>They sat accordingly. And the bit of news was the
following:</p>

<p>“Muriel’s hooked it.”</p>

<p>Respect for her mother tongue caused Mary to demand
a repetition of this cryptic statement.</p>

<p>“Hooked it with her Radical,” Jack amplified. “They
were married yesterday morning, quite quietly, ‘owing
to the indisposition of his Grace,’ the papers say. And
they are now in Scotland on their honeymoon.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope they’ll be happy,” said Mary. “She has
a very brilliant husband, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of that. If brains breed happiness,
they’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>But do brains breed happiness? that was the question
in their minds at the moment. Aunt Charlotte had
brains undoubtedly, but as she passed them three minutes
since no one could have said that she looked happy. The
Duke had brains, but few would have said that he was
happy. Mary herself had brains, and they had brought
her within an ace of wrecking her one chance of real
happiness.</p>

<p>They were in the midst of this philosophical inquiry,
when Chance, that prince of magicians, gave the kaleidoscope
a little loving shake, and hey! presto! the other side
of the picture was laughingly presented to them.</p>

<p>A rather lop-sided young man in a brown bowler hat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
was marching head in air along the gravel in front of
them. One shoulder was a little higher than its neighbor,
his clothes looked shabby in the sun of July, his
gait was slightly grotesque, yet upon his face was a smile
of rare complacency. In one hand he held a small girl
of five, and in the other a small boy to match her; and
that may have been why at this precise moment he looked
as if he had just acquired a controlling interest in the
planet. And yet there must have been some deeper,
subtler reason for this young man’s air of power mingled
with beatitude.</p>

<p>Rather mean of mansion as he was, it was impossible
for two shrewd spectators of the human comedy on the
Park chairs to ignore him as he swung gayly by. In
spite of his impossible hat and his weird trousers, the
mere look on his face was almost cosmic in its significance,
he was so clearly on terms with heaven. But in
any case he would have forcibly entered their scheme of
existence. Just as he came level with them he chanced
to lower his gaze abruptly and by doing so caught the
fascinated eyes of Mary fixed upon his face.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Lawrence. What a nice day!”</p>

<p>He was not in a position to take off his hat, but he
enforced a hearty greeting with a superb bow, and passed
jauntily on.</p>

<p>The Tenderfoot could not help being amused. “Who’s
your friend?” He turned a quizzical eye upon a countenance
glowing with mischief.</p>

<p>“That’s Alf.”</p>

<p>“In the name of all that’s wonderful, who is Alf?”
The tone was expostulation all compact, but as mirth was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
frankly uppermost, even the most sensitive democrat
could hardly have resented it.</p>

<p>“He’s a man on a newspaper.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the Tenderfoot. But somehow it didn’t
explain him.</p>

<p>“An old friend, my dear, and he’s now the Press, with
a capital letter. The other day he interviewed me for
his paper.”</p>

<p>“How could you let him?” gasped the Tenderfoot.</p>

<p>“For the sake of old times.” Suddenly she loosed her
famous note. “That little man is in my stars. He dates
back to my earliest flapperdom, when my great ambition
was to kill him. He was the greengrocer’s boy in the
next street, and he used to call after me:</p>

<p>“Well, I hope,” said the Tenderfoot, “you jolly well
lammed into him for such a piece of infernal cheek.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” she confessed. “One day I turned on
him and boxed his ears, and I’m bound to say he’s been
very respectful ever since. It was very amusing to be
reminded of his existence when he turned up the other
day. He paid me all sorts of extravagant compliments;
he seems to hold himself responsible for any success I
may have had.”</p>

<p>“Nice of him.”</p>

<p>“He says he has written me up for the past two years;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>

<p>“All very honestly meant,” laughed Mary Plantagenet.
“It is very charming of Alf&mdash;a <i>nom de guerre</i>, by the
way. His real name is Michael Conner, but now he’s
Alf of the <i>Millennium</i>. And the other day at our interview,
when he came to talk of old times, somehow I
couldn’t help loving him.”</p>

<p>“What, love&mdash;<i>that</i>!”</p>

<p>“There’s something to love in everybody, my dear. It’s
really very easy to like people if you hunt for the positive&mdash;if
that’s not a high brow way of putting it! The
other day when Alf began to talk of his ambitions, and
of the wife he had married, and of the little Alfs and
the little Alfesses, I thought the more there are of you
the merrier, because after all you are rather fine, you
are good for the community, and you make this old world
go round. Anyhow we began as enemies, and now we
are friends ‘for keeps,’ and both Alf and I are so much
the better for knowing it.”</p>

<p>“I wonder!”</p>

<p>“Of course we are. And when Alf is a great editor,
as he means to be, and he is able to carry out his great
scheme of founding a Universal Love and Admiration
Society, for the purpose of bringing out the best in
everybody, including foreign nations&mdash;his very own idea,
and to my mind a noble one&mdash;he has promised to make
me an original member.”</p>

<p>“A very original member!” The Tenderfoot scoffed.</p>

<p>But sitting there in the eye of the morning, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
gentle leaves whispering over his head, and the finest
girl in the land by his side drawing a fanciful picture of
“Alf” on the gravel with the point of her sunshade, he
was not in the mood for mockery. The world was so
full of a number of things, that it seemed but right and
decent to have these large and generous notions. Let
every atom and molecule that made up the pageant of
human experience overflow in love and admiration of
its neighbor. He was a dud himself, his dwelling-place
was <i>en parterre</i>, yet as heaven was above him and She
was at his elbow, there was no denying that the little man
who had just passed out of sight had laid hold somehow
of a divine idea.</p>

<p>Yes, the ticket for the future was Universal Love and
Admiration, at any rate for the heirs of the good God.
Not a doubt that! He didn’t pretend to be a philosopher,
or a poet, but even he could see that yonder little
scug in the brown pot hat was a big proposition.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he mused aloud, “how the little bounder
came to think of <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>“He says it came to him in his sleep.” And the artist
at his elbow gave one final masterful curl to the amazing
trousers of the latest benefactor of the human species.</p>

mercy of Allah there were fifty minutes yet. A
whole fifty minutes yet to stay in heaven. And
then....</p>

<p>Suddenly hard set by thoughts which had no right to
be there he looked up and away in the direction of Bridport
House.</p>

<p>“There they go!” He gave the pavement artist a
little prod.</p>

<p>“Who&mdash;goes&mdash;where?”</p>

<p>“Cousin Blanche and Cousin Marjorie.”</p>

<p>True enough! Sublimely unconscious of two pairs of
amused eyes upon them, Cousin Blanche and Cousin
Marjorie were passing slowly by. As usual at that hour
they were riding their tall horses. And they became
their tall horses so remarkably well that they might have
belonged to the train of Artemis. In the saddle, at any
rate, Cousin Blanche and Cousin Marjorie looked hard
to beat.</p>

<p>“Now for your precious theory,” said the Tenderfoot
with malice. “Here’s your chance to hunt for the
positive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>She fixed her eyes on the slowly-receding enemy.
“Well, in the first place, my dear, those old-fashioned
habits become them marvelously.”</p>

<p>“No use for that sort of kit myself,” growled the
hostile critic.</p>

<p>“Then they are so much a part of their horses they
might be female centaurs.”</p>

<p>“And about as amusing as female centaurs.”</p>

<p>“But we are hunting for the positive, aren’t we? We
are trying ‘to affirm something,’ as Alf would say. Now
those two and their horses are far grander works of
art than anything that ever came out of Greece or Italy.
It has taken millions of years to produce them and they
are so perfect in their way that one wonders how they
ever came to be produced at all.”</p>

<p>“You might say that of anything or anybody&mdash;if you
come to think of it.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I agree. And so would Alf. And
that’s why universal love and admiration are so proper
and natural.”</p>

<p>“Wait till you are really up against ’em and then
you’ll see.”</p>

<p>“The more I’m up against them&mdash;if I am to be up
against them&mdash;the more I shall love and admire them,
not for what they are perhaps, but for what they might
be if only they’d take a little trouble over their parts in
this wonderful Play, which I’m quite sure the Author
meant to be so very much finer than we silly amateurs
ever give it a chance of becoming.”</p>

<p>The sunshade began to scratch the gravel again, while
Jack Dinneford sighed over its owner’s crude philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>


<p>Presently he began to realize again that they were in
a fool’s paradise. Surely they were taking a climb down
too much for granted. Why should these hardshells
give in so inexplicably? It was in the nature of things
for a flaw to lurk under all this fair-seeming. Only
fools would ever build on such a sublime pretense as
Bridport House. Was it rational to expect its denizens
to behave like ordinary sensible human people?</p>

<p>In order to sidetrack his fears he turned again to
watch the labors of the pavement artist. The tip of a
gifted sunshade was doing wonderful things with the
gravel. It had just evolved a <i>chef d’œuvre</i>, which however
was only apparent to the eye of faith.</p>

<p>“Who do you imagine that is?”</p>

<p>Imagination was certainly needed. It would not have
been possible otherwise to see a resemblance to anything
human.</p>

<p>“That is his lamp,” hovered the sunshade above this
masterpiece. “That is his truncheon. Those are his
boots. That is his overcoat. And there we have his
helmet. And there,” the tip of the sunshade traced
slowly, “the noble profile of the greatest dear in existence.”</p>

<p>At that he was bound to own that had the Park gravel
been more sensitive, here would have been a living portrait
of Sergeant Kelly of the X Division. And even if
it was only visible to the eye of faith it was pretext
enough for honest laughter.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“No one knows her hist’ry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She is wrapt in myst’ry,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>he quoted softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>It was quite true. Various zephyrs and divers little
birds had whispered the romantic fact in their ears long
ago. But what did it matter? It was but one plume
more in the cap of the Magician, a mere detail in that
pageant of which Mystery itself is the last expression.</p>

<p>There may have been wisdom in their laughter. At
any rate it seemed to give them a kind of Dutch courage
for the ordeal that was now so near. But a rather
forced gayety did not long continue; it was soon merged
in a further piece of news which Jack suddenly remembered.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he announced, “there’s more trouble at
Bridport House. My cousins, I hear, are going to live
with Aunt Charlotte.”</p>

<p>She was obliged to ask why, but he had to own that
it was beyond his power to answer her question. All
that he knew was that his cousins were “at serious outs”
with their father, and that according to recent information
they were on the point of leaving the paternal roof.</p>

<p>The Tenderfoot, however, in professing a diplomatic
ignorance of a matter to which he had indiscreetly referred,
had only pulled up in the nick of time. He knew
rather more than he said. “There’s a violent quarrel
about Mrs. Sanderson,” was at the tip of his tongue, but
happily he saw in time that such words in such circumstances
would be pure folly. Nay, it was folly to have
drifted into these perilous waters at all; and in the face
of a suddenly awakened curiosity, he proceeded at once
to steer the talk into a safer channel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="illo3"><img src="images/i_296.jpg" width="300" alt=" “We mustn’t build castles,” she sighed, and the light

<p class="caption"> “We mustn’t build castles,” she sighed, and the<br />
light fringed her eyelids</p>

<p class="p2">After all, that was not very difficult. As they sat under
the whispering leaves, gazing a little wistfully at the
pomp of a summer’s day, heaven was so near that it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>hardly seemed rational to be giving a thought to those
who dwelt in spheres less halcyon. The previous evening
at six o’clock they had parted for ever in this very
spot. But a swift turn of Fate’s shuttle had changed
everything.</p>

<p>As now they tried to understand what had occurred,
it was hard to keep from building castles. An absurd
old planet might prove, after all, such a wonderful place.
When you are four-and-twenty and in love, and the
crooked path suddenly turns to the straight, and the
future is seen through magic vistas just ahead, surprising
things are apt to arise, take shape, acquire a hue, a
meaning. The light that never was on sea or land is
quite likely to be found south of the Marble Arch and
north of Hyde Park Corner. They were on the threshold
of a very wonderful world. What gifts were
theirs! Health, youth, a high-hearted joy in existence,
here were the keys of heaven. Life was what they
chose to make it.</p>

<p>Poetry herself clothed them as with a garment. But
not for a moment must they forget, even amid the dangerous
joys of a rather wild reaction, that all might be
illusion. Voices whispered from the leaves that as yet
they were not out of the wood. Jack, it is true, was fain
to believe that the latest act of Bridport House implied a
very real change of heart. For all that, as the hour of
Fate drew on, he could not stifle a miserable feeling of
nervousness. And Mary, too, in spite of a proud surface
gayety, felt faint within. The dream was far too good
to be true.</p>

<p>“Of <i>course</i> it’s a climb down,” said Jack, whistling to
keep up his courage. “Do you suppose Uncle Albert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
would have sent for us like this unless he meant to chuck
up the sponge?”</p>

<p>“We mustn’t build castles,” she sighed, and the light
fringed her eyelids.</p>

<p>“We’ll build ’em as high as the moon!”</p>

<p>She shook a whimsical head. And then the goad of
youth drove her to a smile of perilous happiness. All
sorts of subtle fears were lurking in that good, shrewd
brain of hers. They were on the verge of chaos and
Old Night&mdash;yet she had not the heart to rebuke him.</p>

<p>The dread hour of one-thirty was now so very near,
that it was idle to disguise the fact that one at least of
the two people on the Park chairs had grown extremely
unhappy. Mary was quite sure that a horrible ordeal
was going to prove too much for her. It was hardly
less than madness to have yielded in the way she had.
But qualms were useless, fears were vain. There was
only one thing to do. She must set her teeth and go
and face the music.</p>

<p class="ph2">II</p>

<p>Punctual to the minute they were at the solemn portals
of Bridport House. And then as a servant in a grotesque
livery piloted them across an expanse of rather
pretentious hall into a somber room, full of grandiose
decoration and Victorian furniture, a grand fighting spirit
suddenly rose in one whose need of it was sore. Mary
was quaking in her shoes, yet the joy of battle came upon
her in the queerest, most unexpected way. It was as if
a magician had waved his wand and all the paltry emotions
of the past hour were dispelled. Perhaps it was
that deep down in her slept an Amazon. Or a clear conscience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
may have inspired her; at any rate she had no
need to reproach herself just then. She could look the
whole world in the face. Her attitude had been sensitively
correct; if other people did not appreciate that
simple fact, so much the worse for other people!</p>

<p>A long five minutes they waited in that large and
dismal room, a slight flush of anxiety upon their faces,
their hearts beating a little wildly, no doubt. In all
that time not a word passed between them; the tension
was almost more than they could bear. If Fate had
kept till the last one final scurvy trick it would be too
horrible! And then suddenly, in the midst of this grim
thought, an old man came hobbling painfully in. Both
were struck at once by the look of him. There was
something in the bearing, in the manner, in the play of
the rather exquisite face which spoke to them intimately.
For a reason deeply obscure, which Jack and Mary were
very far from comprehending, the welcome he gave her
was quite touching. It was full of a simple kindness,
spontaneous, unstudied, oddly caressing.</p>

<p>Jack, amazed not a little by the heart-on-the-sleeve
attitude of this old barbarian, could only ascribe it to the
desire of a finished man of the world to put the best
possible face on an impossible matter. Yet, somehow,
that cynical view did not seem to cover the facts of
the case.</p>

<p>In a way that hardly belonged to a tyrant and an
autocrat, the old man took one of the girl’s hands into
the keeping of his poor enfeebled ones, and was still
holding it when his sister and his eldest daughter came
into the room. Both ladies were firm in the belief that
this was the most disagreeable moment of their lives.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
Still it was their nature to meet things heroically, and
they now proceeded to do so.</p>

<p>The picture their minds had already formed of this
girl was not a pleasing one. But as far as Lady Wargrave
was concerned it was shattered almost instantly.
The likeness between father and daughter was amazing.
She had, in quite a remarkable degree, the look
of noblesse the world had always admired in him, with
which, however, he had signally failed to endow the
daughters of the first marriage. But there was far more
than a superficial likeness to shatter preconceived ideas.
Another, more virile strain was hers. The mettle of
the pasture, the breath of the moorland, had given her
a look of purpose and fire, even if the grace of the
salon had yielded much of its own peculiar amenity.
Whatever else she might be, the youngest daughter of
the House of Dinneford was a personality of a rare but
vivid kind.</p>

<p>As soon as the Duke realized that the ladies had entered
the room, he gravely presented the girl, but with
a touch of chivalry that she simply adored in him. The
little note of homage melted in the oddest way the half-fierce
constraint with which she turned instinctively to
meet these enemies. Sarah bowed rather coldly, but
Aunt Charlotte came forward at once with a proffered
hand.</p>

<p>“My sister,” murmured his Grace. In his eyes was a
certain humor and perhaps a spice of malice.</p>

<p>For a moment speech was impossible. The girl looked
slowly from one to the other, and then suddenly it came
upon her that these people were old and hard hit. She
felt a curious revulsion of feeling. Their surrender was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
unconditional, and woman’s sixth sense told her what
their thoughts must be. They must be suffering horribly.
All at once the fight went out of her.</p>

<p>In a fashion rather odd, with almost the naïveté of a
child, she turned aside in a deadly fight with tears, that
she managed to screw back into her eyes.</p>

<p>It was left to Lady Wargrave to break a silence which
threatened to become bitterly embarrassing: “Come over
here and talk to me,” she said with a directness the girl
was quick to obey.</p>

<p>Lady Wargrave led the way to a couple of empty
chairs near a window, Mary following with a kind sick
timidity she had never felt before, and a heart that
beat convulsively. What could the old dragon have to
say to her? Even now she half expected a talon.</p>

<p>The Dowager pointed to a chair, sat down grimly, and
then said abruptly, “I hope you will be happy.”</p>

<p>There was something in the words that threw the
girl into momentary confusion. The fact was a miracle
had occurred and her bewilderment was seeking a reason
for it. Only one explanation came to her, and it
was that these great powers, rather than suffer Jack to
depart, were ready to make the best of his fiancée. There
was not much comfort in the theory, but no other was
feasible. Place and power, it seemed, were caught in
meshes of their own weaving. And yet bruised in pride
as she was by a situation for which she was not to blame,
the rather splendid bearing of these old hard-bitten warriors
touched a chivalry far down. Deep called unto
deep. At the unexpected words of the griffin, she had
again to screw the tears back into her eyes. And then
she said in a voice that seemed to be stifling her, “It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
not my fault. I didn’t know.... I didn’t want this....
If you will.... If you will help me I will do my best
... not ... to....”</p>

<p>The eyes of the Dowager searched her right through.</p>

<p>“No, you are not to blame,” she said judicially. “We
are all going to help you,” and then in a voice which
cracked in the middle she added, to her own surprise,
“my dear.”</p>

<p class="ph2">III</p>

<p>At luncheon the girl had the place of honor at the
right hand of his Grace. It was a rather chastened assembly.
The arrival of the cuckoo in the nest was a
fitting climax to Muriel. Both episodes were felt to be
buffets of a wholly undeserved severity; they might
even be said to have shaken a sublime edifice to its base.
Not for a moment had the collective wisdom of the
Dinneford ladies connived at Muriel’s Breadth, nor had
it in any way countenanced the absurd fellow Jack in his
infatuation for a chorus girl.</p>

<p>Simple justice, however, compelled these stern critics
to own that Bridport’s future duchess had come as a
rather agreeable surprise. She differed so much from
the person they had expected. They couldn’t deny that
she was a personality. Moreover, there was a force, a
distinction that might hope to mold and even harmonize
with her place in the table of precedence. So good were
her manners that the subtle air of the great world might
one day be hers.</p>

<p>It amazed them to see the effect she had already had
on their fastidious and difficult parent. He was talking
to her of men and events and times past in a way he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
had not talked for years. He discoursed of the great
ones of his youth, the singers and dancers of the ’Sixties
when he was at the Embassy at Paris and ginger was hot
in the mouth. Then by a process of gradation he went
on to tell his old stories of Gladstone and Dizzy, to discuss
books and politics and the pictures in the Uffizi, and
to cap with tales of his own travels an occasional brief
anecdote, wittily told, of her own tours in America and
South Africa.</p>

<p>Sarah, Blanche, and Marjorie could not help feeling
hostile, yet it was clear that this remarkable girl had put
an enchantment on their father. While he talked to her
the table, the room, the people in it seemed to pass beyond
his ken. Candor bred the thought that it was not
to be wondered at, her way of listening was so delightful.
The beautiful head&mdash;it hurt them to admit the fact yet
there it was&mdash;bent towards him in a kind of loving reverence,
changing each phrase of his into something rare
and memorable by a receptivity whose only wish was to
give pleasure to a poor old man struggling with a basin
of arrowroot&mdash;that sight and the sense of a presence alive
in every nerve, a voice of pure music, and a face incapable
of evil: was it surprising that a spell was cast
upon their sire? Take her as one would she was a real
natural force&mdash;an original upon whom the fairies had
lavished many gifts.</p>

<p>The family chieftain was renewing his youth, but only
Charlotte understood why. In common with the rest of
the world, Sarah, Blanche, and Marjorie were to be kept
in ignorance of the truth&mdash;for the present at any rate.
But already the Dinneford ladies had taken further counsel
of the sage of Hill Street, and upon her advice all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
thought of secession from Bridport House had been
given up. Reflection had convinced Lady Wargrave, now
in possession of the light, that the true interests of the
Family would be served by silence and submission. After
all, Mrs. Sanderson was an old and valued retainer; her
integrity was beyond question; her devotion and single-minded
regard for their father’s welfare ought not to be
forgotten!</p>

<p>Taking all the circumstances into account, it was in
Aunt Charlotte’s opinion, a case for humble pie. And to
do the ladies no injustice they were ready to consume it
gracefully. Jack, after all, was quite a distant connection;
and what was even more important in their sight,
the girl herself was presentable. Their father, at any
rate, made no secret of the fact that he found her sympathetic.
Nay, he was even a little carried away by her.
As the meal went on, his manner towards her almost
verged upon affection; and at the end, in open defiance
of his doctors, he went to the length of wishing her
happiness in a glass of famous Madeira.</p>

<p class="ph2">IV</p>

<p>At five minutes past three Mary and Jack awoke with
a start from a dream fantasy, to find themselves breathing
the ampler air of Park Lane. Even then they could
not quite grasp the meaning of all that had happened.
Unconditional surrender indeed, yet so sudden, so causeless,
so mysterious. Why had this strange thing come
to be?</p>

<p>But just now they were not in a mood to question
the inscrutable wisdom of the good God. Behind the
curtain of appearances the sun shone more bravely than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
ever, the dust of July lay a shade lighter on the trees
across the road. No, there was really no need for Providence
to give an account of itself at that moment; the
nature of things called for no analysis.</p>

<p>“I’ve fallen in love with that old man.”</p>

<p>Even if Jack heard the words he was not in a position
to offer comment upon them, for he was in the act of
summoning a taxi from the lee of the Park railings.</p>

<p>“Where shall we go?”</p>

<p>“To the moon and back again?”</p>

<p>And why not! It is not very far to the moon if you
get hold of the right kind of vehicle. But MX 54,906
proved on inspection hardly to be adapted for the purpose;
at any rate Jack came to the conclusion after a
mere glance at the tires that Hampton Court, via Richmond
and Elysium, would meet the case equally well.</p>

<p class="ph2">V</p>

<p>Meanwhile his Grace in his favorite chair in his
favorite room, was doing his best to envisage “The
Outlook for Democracy,” with the aid of the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>. Of a sudden the clock on the chimneypiece
chimed a quarter past three, and he laid down an article
perfect alike in form, taste and scholarship, with the air
of one who expects something to happen.</p>

<p>Something did happen. In almost the same moment,
the housekeeper, Mrs. Sanderson, came into the room.
She carried a tray containing a glass, a spoon, and a
bottle.</p>

<p>His Grace shook his head. “I’ve had a glass of
Madeira.”</p>

<p>“How could you be so unwise!” It was the gentle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
half-smiling tone of a mother who reproves a very dear
but willful child.</p>

<p>She measured the draught inflexibly and he drank
it like a man. As he returned the glass to the tray he
sighed a little, and then with a whimsical glance upwards
he said slowly and softly, “She has her mother’s brains.”</p>

<p>As she looked down upon him, he saw the color darkening
a strong and beautiful face. “And her father’s
eyes.” The warmth of her voice almost stifled the words.</p>

<p>For nearly a minute there was so deep a silence that
even the clock on the chimneypiece was lost in it. And
then very slowly and gently, as one who thinks aloud,
he said, “I am trying to remember those words of Milton.”
He closed his eyes with a smile of perplexity.
“Ah, yes, yes. I have them now:</p>

<p>“‘He for God only, she for God in him.’”</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
